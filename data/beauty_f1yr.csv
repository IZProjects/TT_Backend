"Microneedle Patches ","Microneedle patches are a relatively recent development in medical technology, designed to deliver drugs or vaccines through the skin in a minimally invasive way. They consist of an array of tiny needles, often made from materials like silicon, metal, or polymers, which are small enough to avoid causing pain but large enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin. This method can improve the delivery of medications by bypassing the digestive system and directly entering the bloodstream, potentially increasing the efficacy and speed of drug delivery.","beauty,skincare,health,makeup-cosmetics,personal-care,cpg","No","+65%",6600,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Positive","Growing","1 Year (Forecast)","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/microneedle-patches-1","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.50, LinkedIn: 0.34, Pinterest: 0.51, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.59, Twitter: 0.36, YouTube: 0.40","06/08/2025: 1570, 06/15/2025: 1534, 06/22/2025: 1624, 06/29/2025: 1570, 07/06/2025: 1677, 07/13/2025: 1588, 07/20/2025: 1695, 07/27/2025: 1641, 08/03/2025: 1695, 08/10/2025: 1677, 08/17/2025: 1695, 08/24/2025: 1713, 08/31/2025: 1677, 09/07/2025: 1766, 09/14/2025: 1695, 09/21/2025: 1802, 09/28/2025: 1731, 10/05/2025: 1873, 10/12/2025: 1820, 10/19/2025: 1963, 10/26/2025: 1963, 11/02/2025: 2070, 11/09/2025: 2106, 11/16/2025: 2088, 11/23/2025: 2123, 11/30/2025: 2016, 12/07/2025: 2070, 12/14/2025: 1927, 12/21/2025: 2052, 12/28/2025: 1963, 01/04/2026: 2123, 01/11/2026: 2070, 01/18/2026: 2177, 01/25/2026: 2159, 02/01/2026: 2159, 02/08/2026: 2177, 02/15/2026: 2123, 02/22/2026: 2195, 03/01/2026: 2106, 03/08/2026: 2266, 03/15/2026: 2177, 03/22/2026: 2373, 03/29/2026: 2302, 04/05/2026: 2480, 04/12/2026: 2480, 04/19/2026: 2587, 04/26/2026: 2623, 05/03/2026: 2587, 05/10/2026: 2623, 05/17/2026: 2480"

"Nose Patch","A nose patch is a skincare product specifically designed to cleanse and remove blackheads, dirt, and excess oil from the pores on the nose. Typically made of adhesive material, the patch is applied to damp skin, allowed to dry, and then peeled off, lifting impurities from the skin's surface. Nose patches are popular among individuals with oily or combination skin, or those looking for a quick and targeted solution to improve the appearance of their nose area.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare,personal-care,cpg","No","+13%",9900,"Exploding","Exponential","Medium","Low","Positive","Growing","1 Year (Forecast)","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/nose-patch","Facebook: 0.52, Instagram: 0.55, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.57, Reddit: 0.46, TikTok: 0.72, Twitter: 0.19, YouTube: 0.46","06/08/2025: 2416, 06/15/2025: 2387, 06/22/2025: 2444, 06/29/2025: 2501, 07/06/2025: 2416, 07/13/2025: 2416, 07/20/2025: 2529, 07/27/2025: 2472, 08/03/2025: 2444, 08/10/2025: 2529, 08/17/2025: 2472, 08/24/2025: 2387, 08/31/2025: 2472, 09/07/2025: 2501, 09/14/2025: 2416, 09/21/2025: 2501, 09/28/2025: 2614, 10/05/2025: 2558, 10/12/2025: 2586, 10/19/2025: 2671, 10/26/2025: 2586, 11/02/2025: 2501, 11/09/2025: 2529, 11/16/2025: 2501, 11/23/2025: 2387, 11/30/2025: 2472, 12/07/2025: 2501, 12/14/2025: 2472, 12/21/2025: 2529, 12/28/2025: 2700, 01/04/2026: 2700, 01/11/2026: 2757, 01/18/2026: 2899, 01/25/2026: 2842, 02/01/2026: 2757, 02/08/2026: 2813, 02/15/2026: 2785, 02/22/2026: 2643, 03/01/2026: 2671, 03/08/2026: 2700, 03/15/2026: 2586, 03/22/2026: 2614, 03/29/2026: 2700, 04/05/2026: 2643, 04/12/2026: 2614, 04/19/2026: 2728, 04/26/2026: 2728, 05/03/2026: 2643, 05/10/2026: 2728, 05/17/2026: 2757"
