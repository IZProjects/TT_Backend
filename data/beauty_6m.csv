Nano hydroxyapatite is particularly targeted at individuals looking for advanced oral care solutions, including those with tooth sensitivity or a high risk of enamel erosion.","health,supplements,personal-care,beauty,cpg","No","+141%",40500,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Neutral","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/nano-hydroxyapatite","Facebook: 0.59, Instagram: 0.59, LinkedIn: 0.42, Pinterest: 0.65, Reddit: 0.57, TikTok: 0.77, Twitter: 0.47, YouTube: 0.51","11/24/2024: 3905, 12/01/2024: 4134, 12/08/2024: 4134, 12/15/2024: 4134, 12/22/2024: 4364, 12/29/2024: 6776, 01/05/2025: 5283, 01/12/2025: 6087, 01/19/2025: 7465, 01/26/2025: 8040, 02/02/2025: 9992, 02/09/2025: 8040, 02/16/2025: 7121, 02/23/2025: 6776, 03/02/2025: 8384, 03/09/2025: 8269, 03/16/2025: 9418, 03/23/2025: 6661, 03/30/2025: 8155, 04/06/2025: 7925, 04/13/2025: 7695, 04/20/2025: 7580, 04/27/2025: 10567, 05/04/2025: 11486, 05/11/2025: 10107, 05/18/2025: 9418, 06/08/2025: 9763, 06/15/2025: 9878, 06/22/2025: 9648, 06/29/2025: 10107, 07/06/2025: 10337, 07/13/2025: 10107, 07/20/2025: 10452, 07/27/2025: 10567, 08/03/2025: 10222, 08/10/2025: 10682, 08/17/2025: 10796, 08/24/2025: 10682, 08/31/2025: 11026, 09/07/2025: 11141, 09/14/2025: 11026, 09/21/2025: 11371, 09/28/2025: 11715, 10/05/2025: 11371, 10/12/2025: 11945, 10/19/2025: 12175, 10/26/2025: 11945, 11/02/2025: 12519, 11/09/2025: 12749, 11/16/2025: 12404, 11/23/2025: 12979, 11/30/2025: 13209, 12/07/2025: 12979, 12/14/2025: 13438, 12/21/2025: 14013, 12/28/2025: 13898, 01/04/2026: 14702, 01/11/2026: 15161, 01/18/2026: 15046, 01/25/2026: 15735, 02/01/2026: 15965, 02/08/2026: 15506, 02/15/2026: 16080, 02/22/2026: 16195, 03/01/2026: 15621, 03/08/2026: 16195, 03/15/2026: 16195, 03/22/2026: 15850, 03/29/2026: 16310, 04/05/2026: 16425, 04/12/2026: 15850, 04/19/2026: 16425, 04/26/2026: 16654, 05/03/2026: 16195, 05/10/2026: 16769, 05/17/2026: 16999"

"Microneedle patches","Microneedle patches are a type of transdermal drug delivery system that uses an array of tiny needles to painlessly penetrate the outer layer of the skin.

"Chemical sunscreen","Chemical sunscreens use organic compounds to absorb UV radiation and convert it into heat, which is then released from the skin. These sunscreens often contain ingredients like avobenzone, octinoxate, oxybenzone, and octocrylene, and are known for being lightweight and non-greasy, although they may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. Chemical sunscreens are typically favored by individuals seeking a lightweight, non-greasy sun protection option, but they may also be scrutinized by those concerned about potential skin sensitivities and environmental impact.","beauty,health,skincare,personal-care,cpg","No","+105%",33100,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Neutral","Declining","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/chemical-sunscreen","Facebook: 0.63, Instagram: 0.71, LinkedIn: 0.18, Pinterest: 0.64, Reddit: 0.67, TikTok: 0.77, Twitter: 0.52, YouTube: 0.57","12/01/2024: 3757, 12/08/2024: 4032, 12/15/2024: 3573, 12/22/2024: 3482, 12/29/2024: 4215, 01/05/2025: 4398, 01/12/2025: 4032, 01/19/2025: 3848, 01/26/2025: 4398, 02/02/2025: 5315, 02/09/2025: 4765, 02/16/2025: 4948, 02/23/2025: 5681, 03/02/2025: 5131, 03/09/2025: 5315, 03/16/2025: 7056, 03/23/2025: 6964, 03/30/2025: 7422, 04/06/2025: 7147, 04/13/2025: 7514, 04/20/2025: 6781, 04/27/2025: 8522, 05/04/2025: 7239, 05/11/2025: 8339, 05/18/2025: 8522, 05/25/2025: 7697, 06/08/2025: 8705, 06/15/2025: 8339, 06/22/2025: 8247, 06/29/2025: 8247, 07/06/2025: 7789, 07/13/2025: 7606, 07/20/2025: 7514, 07/27/2025: 7147, 08/03/2025: 7056, 08/10/2025: 6872, 08/17/2025: 6598, 08/24/2025: 6414, 08/31/2025: 6323, 09/07/2025: 5956, 09/14/2025: 5773, 09/21/2025: 5681, 09/28/2025: 5315, 10/05/2025: 5223, 10/12/2025: 5040, 10/19/2025: 4765, 10/26/2025: 4673, 11/02/2025: 4673, 11/09/2025: 4490, 11/16/2025: 4398, 11/23/2025: 4398, 11/30/2025: 4215, 12/07/2025: 4215, 12/14/2025: 4307, 12/21/2025: 4307, 12/28/2025: 4398, 01/04/2026: 4765, 01/11/2026: 4856, 01/18/2026: 5040, 01/25/2026: 5223, 02/01/2026: 5315, 02/08/2026: 5498, 02/15/2026: 5681, 02/22/2026: 5681, 03/01/2026: 5956, 03/08/2026: 6231, 03/15/2026: 6323, 03/22/2026: 6598, 03/29/2026: 6964, 04/05/2026: 6964, 04/12/2026: 7239, 04/19/2026: 7606, 04/26/2026: 7697, 05/03/2026: 8064, 05/10/2026: 8430"

"Microneedle Patches ","Microneedle patches are a relatively recent development in medical technology, designed to deliver drugs or vaccines through the skin in a minimally invasive way. They consist of an array of tiny needles, often made from materials like silicon, metal, or polymers, which are small enough to avoid causing pain but large enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin. This method can improve the delivery of medications by bypassing the digestive system and directly entering the bloodstream, potentially increasing the efficacy and speed of drug delivery.","beauty,skincare,health,makeup-cosmetics,personal-care,cpg","No","+43%",6600,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/microneedle-patches-1","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.50, LinkedIn: 0.34, Pinterest: 0.51, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.59, Twitter: 0.36, YouTube: 0.40","11/24/2024: 1070, 12/01/2024: 874, 12/08/2024: 963, 12/15/2024: 767, 12/22/2024: 1035, 12/29/2024: 749, 01/05/2025: 928, 01/12/2025: 910, 01/19/2025: 910, 01/26/2025: 910, 02/02/2025: 838, 02/09/2025: 713, 02/16/2025: 660, 02/23/2025: 571, 03/02/2025: 874, 03/09/2025: 981, 03/16/2025: 981, 03/23/2025: 1106, 03/30/2025: 1392, 04/06/2025: 1552, 04/13/2025: 1570, 04/20/2025: 1534, 04/27/2025: 1463, 05/04/2025: 1302, 05/11/2025: 1231, 05/18/2025: 1534, 06/08/2025: 1570, 06/15/2025: 1534, 06/22/2025: 1624, 06/29/2025: 1570, 07/06/2025: 1677, 07/13/2025: 1588, 07/20/2025: 1695, 07/27/2025: 1641, 08/03/2025: 1695, 08/10/2025: 1677, 08/17/2025: 1695, 08/24/2025: 1713, 08/31/2025: 1677, 09/07/2025: 1766, 09/14/2025: 1695, 09/21/2025: 1802, 09/28/2025: 1731, 10/05/2025: 1873, 10/12/2025: 1820, 10/19/2025: 1963, 10/26/2025: 1963, 11/02/2025: 2070, 11/09/2025: 2106, 11/16/2025: 2088, 11/23/2025: 2123, 11/30/2025: 2016, 12/07/2025: 2070, 12/14/2025: 1927, 12/21/2025: 2052, 12/28/2025: 1963, 01/04/2026: 2123, 01/11/2026: 2070, 01/18/2026: 2177, 01/25/2026: 2159, 02/01/2026: 2159, 02/08/2026: 2177, 02/15/2026: 2123, 02/22/2026: 2195, 03/01/2026: 2106, 03/08/2026: 2266, 03/15/2026: 2177, 03/22/2026: 2373, 03/29/2026: 2302, 04/05/2026: 2480, 04/12/2026: 2480, 04/19/2026: 2587, 04/26/2026: 2623, 05/03/2026: 2587, 05/10/2026: 2623, 05/17/2026: 2480"

Urea cream is particularly beneficial for individuals with extremely dry or damaged skin who need intensive hydration and skin barrier support.","beauty,skincare,health,personal-care,cpg","No","+28%",165000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/urea-cream-1","Facebook: 0.66, Instagram: 0.58, LinkedIn: 0.20, Pinterest: 0.62, Reddit: 0.57, TikTok: 0.80, Twitter: 0.17, YouTube: 0.53","12/01/2024: 29900, 12/08/2024: 32890, 12/15/2024: 41860, 12/22/2024: 41362, 12/29/2024: 39368, 01/05/2025: 33388, 01/12/2025: 35880, 01/19/2025: 39368, 01/26/2025: 37873, 02/02/2025: 38372, 02/09/2025: 36378, 02/16/2025: 37873, 02/23/2025: 41362, 03/02/2025: 35880, 03/09/2025: 42857, 03/16/2025: 49833, 03/23/2025: 44352, 03/30/2025: 40863, 04/06/2025: 40365, 04/13/2025: 40365, 04/20/2025: 41860, 04/27/2025: 43355, 05/04/2025: 39368, 05/11/2025: 38372, 05/18/2025: 38870, 05/25/2025: 38372, 06/08/2025: 43853, 06/15/2025: 43853, 06/22/2025: 43853, 06/29/2025: 43853, 07/06/2025: 43355, 07/13/2025: 43355, 07/20/2025: 42857, 07/27/2025: 42358, 08/03/2025: 41860, 08/10/2025: 41362, 08/17/2025: 40863, 08/24/2025: 40365, 08/31/2025: 39867, 09/07/2025: 39368, 09/14/2025: 38870, 09/21/2025: 38870, 09/28/2025: 38372, 10/05/2025: 38372, 10/12/2025: 37873, 10/19/2025: 37375, 10/26/2025: 37375, 11/02/2025: 36877, 11/09/2025: 36378, 11/16/2025: 36378, 11/23/2025: 36378, 11/30/2025: 36378, 12/07/2025: 36378, 12/14/2025: 36378, 12/21/2025: 36378, 12/28/2025: 36378, 01/04/2026: 36378, 01/11/2026: 35880, 01/18/2026: 35880, 01/25/2026: 35880, 02/01/2026: 35382, 02/08/2026: 34883, 02/15/2026: 34883, 02/22/2026: 34883, 03/01/2026: 34385, 03/08/2026: 34385, 03/15/2026: 34385, 03/22/2026: 34385, 03/29/2026: 33887, 04/05/2026: 33887, 04/12/2026: 33887, 04/19/2026: 33388, 04/26/2026: 33388, 05/03/2026: 33388, 05/10/2026: 33388"

Hydrocolloid acne patches are commonly used by individuals with active pimples or minor skin blemishes, offering a discreet and effective spot-treatment solution.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare,personal-care,cpg","No","+11%",2900,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Low","Positive","Stationary","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/hydrocolloid-acne-patch","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.58, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.55, Reddit: 0.15, TikTok: 0.55, Twitter: 0.04, YouTube: 0.36","11/24/2024: 609, 12/01/2024: 582, 12/08/2024: 665, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 674, 12/29/2024: 739, 01/05/2025: 591, 01/12/2025: 674, 01/19/2025: 526, 01/26/2025: 757, 02/02/2025: 702, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 757, 03/02/2025: 609, 03/09/2025: 646, 03/16/2025: 757, 03/23/2025: 729, 03/30/2025: 896, 04/06/2025: 886, 04/13/2025: 655, 04/20/2025: 674, 04/27/2025: 683, 05/04/2025: 609, 05/11/2025: 609, 05/18/2025: 674, 06/08/2025: 702, 06/15/2025: 674, 06/22/2025: 591, 06/29/2025: 665, 07/06/2025: 646, 07/13/2025: 572, 07/20/2025: 665, 07/27/2025: 665, 08/03/2025: 591, 08/10/2025: 674, 08/17/2025: 655, 08/24/2025: 563, 08/31/2025: 618, 09/07/2025: 609, 09/14/2025: 526, 09/21/2025: 591, 09/28/2025: 591, 10/05/2025: 526, 10/12/2025: 582, 10/19/2025: 572, 10/26/2025: 498, 11/02/2025: 554, 11/09/2025: 545, 11/16/2025: 480, 11/23/2025: 535, 11/30/2025: 545, 12/07/2025: 489, 12/14/2025: 572, 12/21/2025: 591, 12/28/2025: 545, 01/04/2026: 646, 01/11/2026: 655, 01/18/2026: 591, 01/25/2026: 674, 02/01/2026: 665, 02/08/2026: 582, 02/15/2026: 655, 02/22/2026: 637, 03/01/2026: 563, 03/08/2026: 646, 03/15/2026: 637, 03/22/2026: 572, 03/29/2026: 655, 04/05/2026: 646, 04/12/2026: 572, 04/19/2026: 655, 04/26/2026: 646, 05/03/2026: 572, 05/10/2026: 655, 05/17/2026: 655"
