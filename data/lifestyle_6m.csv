"Cannibalism in poultry","Cannibalism in poultry is a behavioral issue where birds peck at the feathers, comb, toes, or vent of other birds, often leading to open wounds. This behavior is typically triggered by stress due to poor management practices and can rapidly spread throughout the flock once blood or an open wound is visible. The issue primarily affects poultry farmers and those involved in poultry management, as it can lead to significant health and welfare problems within the flock.","industry,lifestyle,pets,gardening-agriculture,education","No","+5700%",1900,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","High","Negative","Stationary","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cannibalism-in-poultry","Facebook: 0.37, Instagram: 0.03, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.07, Reddit: 0.06, TikTok: 0.13, Twitter: 0.14, YouTube: 0.34","12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 0, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 0, 01/19/2025: 0, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 678, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 0, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 0, 05/11/2025: 53, 05/18/2025: 342, 05/25/2025: 441, 06/08/2025: 175, 06/15/2025: 114, 06/22/2025: 144, 06/29/2025: 190, 07/06/2025: 137, 07/13/2025: 121, 07/20/2025: 190, 07/27/2025: 167, 08/03/2025: 114, 08/10/2025: 159, 08/17/2025: 182, 08/24/2025: 114, 08/31/2025: 121, 09/07/2025: 167, 09/14/2025: 129, 09/21/2025: 114, 09/28/2025: 175, 10/05/2025: 182, 10/12/2025: 129, 10/19/2025: 167, 10/26/2025: 205, 11/02/2025: 137, 11/09/2025: 129, 11/16/2025: 190, 11/23/2025: 152, 11/30/2025: 106, 12/07/2025: 159, 12/14/2025: 175, 12/21/2025: 114, 12/28/2025: 129, 01/04/2026: 182, 01/11/2026: 137, 01/18/2026: 121, 01/25/2026: 182, 02/01/2026: 175, 02/08/2026: 121, 02/15/2026: 159, 02/22/2026: 190, 03/01/2026: 129, 03/08/2026: 129, 03/15/2026: 182, 03/22/2026: 152, 03/29/2026: 114, 04/05/2026: 175, 04/12/2026: 182, 04/19/2026: 129, 04/26/2026: 159, 05/03/2026: 213, 05/10/2026: 152, 05/17/2026: 137"

"Weed burner","A weed burner, also known as a flame weeder, is a tool used to control weeds by applying intense heat to the plant tissue. This method aims to destroy the above-ground parts of the weed, causing the plant to die without the need for chemicals. It is particularly useful for gardeners and farmers looking for an eco-friendly way to manage annual weeds, though perennial weeds may regrow from their roots.","home,industry,lifestyle,gardening-agriculture,manufacturing","No","+226%",49500,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/weed-burner","Facebook: 0.58, Instagram: 0.38, LinkedIn: 0.05, Pinterest: 0.55, Reddit: 0.47, TikTok: 0.40, Twitter: 0.21, YouTube: 0.60","12/01/2024: 3530, 12/08/2024: 3376, 12/15/2024: 3530, 12/22/2024: 2609, 12/29/2024: 3069, 01/05/2025: 4144, 01/12/2025: 3376, 01/19/2025: 2762, 01/26/2025: 2762, 02/02/2025: 2762, 02/09/2025: 2762, 02/16/2025: 3530, 02/23/2025: 3530, 03/02/2025: 4604, 03/09/2025: 4144, 03/16/2025: 4758, 03/23/2025: 5679, 03/30/2025: 6446, 04/06/2025: 9669, 04/13/2025: 9362, 04/20/2025: 10130, 04/27/2025: 14888, 05/04/2025: 15195, 05/11/2025: 15348, 05/18/2025: 12279, 05/25/2025: 11511, 06/08/2025: 12893, 06/15/2025: 12893, 06/22/2025: 12739, 06/29/2025: 13046, 07/06/2025: 13353, 07/13/2025: 13813, 07/20/2025: 14581, 07/27/2025: 14888, 08/03/2025: 15348, 08/10/2025: 15348, 08/17/2025: 14734, 08/24/2025: 14120, 08/31/2025: 13353, 09/07/2025: 12279, 09/14/2025: 11511, 09/21/2025: 10897, 09/28/2025: 10283, 10/05/2025: 9823, 10/12/2025: 9516, 10/19/2025: 9209, 10/26/2025: 9209, 11/02/2025: 8902, 11/09/2025: 9055, 11/16/2025: 8595, 11/23/2025: 8288, 11/30/2025: 7981, 12/07/2025: 7520, 12/14/2025: 7060, 12/21/2025: 7060, 12/28/2025: 6753, 01/04/2026: 6600, 01/11/2026: 6139, 01/18/2026: 6139, 01/25/2026: 6139, 02/01/2026: 5679, 02/08/2026: 5525, 02/15/2026: 5525, 02/22/2026: 5372, 03/01/2026: 5218, 03/08/2026: 5525, 03/15/2026: 5679, 03/22/2026: 6139, 03/29/2026: 6906, 04/05/2026: 7520, 04/12/2026: 8441, 04/19/2026: 9362, 04/26/2026: 10283, 05/03/2026: 11204, 05/10/2026: 12125, 05/17/2026: 12586"

This approach to childbirth is chosen by some for greater independence and a more natural birthing experience, but it comes with certain risks, including potential complications that may require medical intervention. Freebirth is primarily considered by individuals who prefer a highly personal and autonomous birthing process, often valuing minimal medical intervention.","health,lifestyle,healthcare,baby,education","No","+57%",140,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Neutral","Stationary","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/freebirth","Facebook: 0.55, Instagram: 0.73, LinkedIn: 0.38, Pinterest: 0.51, Reddit: 0.58, TikTok: 0.66, Twitter: 0.54, YouTube: 0.63","12/01/2024: 20, 12/08/2024: 23, 12/15/2024: 30, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 23, 01/12/2025: 42, 01/19/2025: 20, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 24, 02/09/2025: 33, 02/16/2025: 36, 02/23/2025: 19, 03/02/2025: 20, 03/09/2025: 22, 03/16/2025: 24, 03/23/2025: 33, 03/30/2025: 60, 04/06/2025: 24, 04/13/2025: 33, 04/20/2025: 32, 04/27/2025: 23, 05/04/2025: 42, 05/11/2025: 37, 05/18/2025: 38, 05/25/2025: 32, 06/08/2025: 54, 06/15/2025: 54, 06/22/2025: 51, 06/29/2025: 45, 07/06/2025: 40, 07/13/2025: 35, 07/20/2025: 31, 07/27/2025: 29, 08/03/2025: 29, 08/10/2025: 32, 08/17/2025: 36, 08/24/2025: 41, 08/31/2025: 44, 09/07/2025: 47, 09/14/2025: 47, 09/21/2025: 45, 09/28/2025: 41, 10/05/2025: 36, 10/12/2025: 32, 10/19/2025: 29, 10/26/2025: 28, 11/02/2025: 29, 11/09/2025: 33, 11/16/2025: 37, 11/23/2025: 42, 11/30/2025: 45, 12/07/2025: 47, 12/14/2025: 46, 12/21/2025: 43, 12/28/2025: 40, 01/04/2026: 37, 01/11/2026: 33, 01/18/2026: 33, 01/25/2026: 34, 02/01/2026: 39, 02/08/2026: 45, 02/15/2026: 52, 02/22/2026: 58, 03/01/2026: 60, 03/08/2026: 58, 03/15/2026: 53, 03/22/2026: 46, 03/29/2026: 40, 04/05/2026: 34, 04/12/2026: 31, 04/19/2026: 30, 04/26/2026: 31, 05/03/2026: 34, 05/10/2026: 37"

Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's 40s but can start as early as the mid-30s, affecting women who are approaching menopause.","health,industry,lifestyle,fitness,healthcare,pharma","No","+49%",550000,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Neutral","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/perimenopause","Facebook: 0.94, Instagram: 1.00, LinkedIn: 0.96, Pinterest: 0.98, Reddit: 1.00, TikTok: 1.00, Twitter: 0.82, YouTube: 0.95","12/01/2024: 85710, 12/08/2024: 90985, 12/15/2024: 85710, 12/22/2024: 85710, 12/29/2024: 97578, 01/05/2025: 104171, 01/12/2025: 102853, 01/19/2025: 94941, 01/26/2025: 101534, 02/02/2025: 101534, 02/09/2025: 100215, 02/16/2025: 104171, 02/23/2025: 112083, 03/02/2025: 110764, 03/09/2025: 114720, 03/16/2025: 114720, 03/23/2025: 117357, 03/30/2025: 131862, 04/06/2025: 117357, 04/13/2025: 116039, 04/20/2025: 123951, 04/27/2025: 122632, 05/04/2025: 117357, 05/11/2025: 119995, 05/18/2025: 117357, 05/25/2025: 127906, 06/08/2025: 123951, 06/15/2025: 125269, 06/22/2025: 125269, 06/29/2025: 131862, 07/06/2025: 130544, 07/13/2025: 131862, 07/20/2025: 135818, 07/27/2025: 133181, 08/03/2025: 134500, 08/10/2025: 135818, 08/17/2025: 131862, 08/24/2025: 135818, 08/31/2025: 134500, 09/07/2025: 134500, 09/14/2025: 138456, 09/21/2025: 137137, 09/28/2025: 139774, 10/05/2025: 142411, 10/12/2025: 139774, 10/19/2025: 143730, 10/26/2025: 141093, 11/02/2025: 135818, 11/09/2025: 137137, 11/16/2025: 133181, 11/23/2025: 131862, 11/30/2025: 133181, 12/07/2025: 129225, 12/14/2025: 131862, 12/21/2025: 134500, 12/28/2025: 134500, 01/04/2026: 141093, 01/11/2026: 142411, 01/18/2026: 145049, 01/25/2026: 151642, 02/01/2026: 149005, 02/08/2026: 151642, 02/15/2026: 152960, 02/22/2026: 150323, 03/01/2026: 155598, 03/08/2026: 155598, 03/15/2026: 155598, 03/22/2026: 162191, 03/29/2026: 160872, 04/05/2026: 163509, 04/12/2026: 168784, 04/19/2026: 166147, 04/26/2026: 170103, 05/03/2026: 170103, 05/10/2026: 163509, 05/17/2026: 166147"

The product is primarily used by athletes, individuals with muscle tension, and those seeking natural remedies for stress and sleep issues.","beauty,health,lifestyle,skincare,fitness,sleep,cpg","No","+46%",74000,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/magnesium-oil-fhHJTbhL","Facebook: 0.82, Instagram: 0.80, LinkedIn: 0.37, Pinterest: 0.90, Reddit: 0.59, TikTok: 0.88, Twitter: 0.57, YouTube: 0.66","12/01/2024: 11759, 12/08/2024: 11759, 12/15/2024: 11472, 12/22/2024: 11759, 12/29/2024: 16635, 01/05/2025: 13767, 01/12/2025: 17496, 01/19/2025: 17782, 01/26/2025: 16635, 02/02/2025: 14914, 02/09/2025: 14914, 02/16/2025: 14914, 02/23/2025: 14914, 03/02/2025: 14054, 03/09/2025: 12906, 03/16/2025: 12333, 03/23/2025: 12620, 03/30/2025: 13193, 04/06/2025: 13480, 04/13/2025: 15488, 04/20/2025: 13767, 04/27/2025: 14054, 05/04/2025: 12333, 05/11/2025: 13193, 05/18/2025: 14341, 05/25/2025: 17209, 06/08/2025: 12620, 06/15/2025: 13193, 06/22/2025: 13480, 06/29/2025: 13767, 07/06/2025: 14054, 07/13/2025: 14054, 07/20/2025: 14054, 07/27/2025: 14054, 08/03/2025: 14054, 08/10/2025: 14054, 08/17/2025: 13767, 08/24/2025: 13767, 08/31/2025: 13767, 09/07/2025: 13767, 09/14/2025: 14054, 09/21/2025: 14627, 09/28/2025: 14914, 10/05/2025: 15201, 10/12/2025: 15488, 10/19/2025: 15775, 10/26/2025: 15488, 11/02/2025: 15488, 11/09/2025: 15201, 11/16/2025: 15201, 11/23/2025: 14914, 11/30/2025: 14627, 12/07/2025: 14341, 12/14/2025: 14627, 12/21/2025: 15201, 12/28/2025: 16062, 01/04/2026: 16922, 01/11/2026: 17782, 01/18/2026: 18643, 01/25/2026: 18930, 02/01/2026: 18930, 02/08/2026: 18643, 02/15/2026: 18643, 02/22/2026: 18069, 03/01/2026: 18069, 03/08/2026: 18069, 03/15/2026: 17782, 03/22/2026: 17782, 03/29/2026: 17496, 04/05/2026: 17209, 04/12/2026: 17209, 04/19/2026: 16922, 04/26/2026: 16922, 05/03/2026: 17209, 05/10/2026: 17209"
"Monocropping","Monocropping is an agricultural practice where a single crop species is grown in the same field year after year. This method is often used in large-scale farming operations due to its efficiency and the ease of mechanization, but it can lead to increased vulnerability to pests and diseases, depletion of soil nutrients, and reduced biodiversity. Monocropping primarily benefits large-scale farmers and agribusinesses seeking to maximize yield and streamline production processes.","industry,lifestyle,eco,gardening-agriculture","No","+46%",8100,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Negative","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/monocropping","Facebook: 0.38, Instagram: 0.36, LinkedIn: 0.38, Pinterest: 0.18, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.19, Twitter: 0.46, YouTube: 0.41","12/01/2024: 1291, 12/08/2024: 1318, 12/15/2024: 1022, 12/22/2024: 645, 12/29/2024: 753, 01/05/2025: 1076, 01/12/2025: 1264, 01/19/2025: 1399, 01/26/2025: 1614, 02/02/2025: 1668, 02/09/2025: 1641, 02/16/2025: 1426, 02/23/2025: 1776, 03/02/2025: 1560, 03/09/2025: 1776, 03/16/2025: 1614, 03/23/2025: 1560, 03/30/2025: 1722, 04/06/2025: 1991, 04/13/2025: 2233, 04/20/2025: 2341, 04/27/2025: 2691, 05/04/2025: 2448, 05/11/2025: 2314, 05/18/2025: 2018, 05/25/2025: 1883, 06/08/2025: 1802, 06/15/2025: 1668, 06/22/2025: 1587, 06/29/2025: 1560, 07/06/2025: 1453, 07/13/2025: 1453, 07/20/2025: 1453, 07/27/2025: 1426, 08/03/2025: 1453, 08/10/2025: 1506, 08/17/2025: 1506, 08/24/2025: 1533, 08/31/2025: 1587, 09/07/2025: 1560, 09/14/2025: 1587, 09/21/2025: 1614, 09/28/2025: 1560, 10/05/2025: 1587, 10/12/2025: 1587, 10/19/2025: 1533, 10/26/2025: 1533, 11/02/2025: 1533, 11/09/2025: 1453, 11/16/2025: 1426, 11/23/2025: 1372, 11/30/2025: 1264, 12/07/2025: 1210, 12/14/2025: 1210, 12/21/2025: 1157, 12/28/2025: 1184, 01/04/2026: 1264, 01/11/2026: 1291, 01/18/2026: 1372, 01/25/2026: 1506, 02/01/2026: 1533, 02/08/2026: 1641, 02/15/2026: 1722, 02/22/2026: 1695, 03/01/2026: 1749, 03/08/2026: 1776, 03/15/2026: 1722, 03/22/2026: 1776, 03/29/2026: 1856, 04/05/2026: 1856, 04/12/2026: 1991, 04/19/2026: 2179, 04/26/2026: 2206, 05/03/2026: 2314, 05/10/2026: 2475"

PHEVs are particularly beneficial for environmentally conscious consumers and those looking to reduce fuel costs while maintaining the convenience of a traditional vehicle.","technology,industry,lifestyle,automotive,eco","No","+26%",110000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Positive","Growing","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/phev","Facebook: 1.00, Instagram: 0.97, LinkedIn: 0.90, Pinterest: 0.90, Reddit: 1.00, TikTok: 0.95, Twitter: 0.96, YouTube: 1.00","12/01/2024: 20360, 12/08/2024: 22187, 12/15/2024: 22448, 12/22/2024: 21665, 12/29/2024: 23754, 01/05/2025: 24798, 01/12/2025: 25059, 01/19/2025: 24537, 01/26/2025: 23493, 02/02/2025: 25320, 02/09/2025: 24798, 02/16/2025: 24798, 02/23/2025: 24798, 03/02/2025: 23754, 03/09/2025: 23754, 03/16/2025: 25320, 03/23/2025: 26103, 03/30/2025: 23754, 04/06/2025: 24015, 04/13/2025: 23493, 04/20/2025: 25059, 04/27/2025: 22971, 05/04/2025: 22971, 05/11/2025: 25059, 05/18/2025: 25842, 05/25/2025: 25581, 06/08/2025: 26103, 06/15/2025: 25320, 06/22/2025: 25581, 06/29/2025: 26364, 07/06/2025: 26103, 07/13/2025: 25320, 07/20/2025: 26103, 07/27/2025: 26625, 08/03/2025: 26364, 08/10/2025: 25842, 08/17/2025: 26625, 08/24/2025: 26625, 08/31/2025: 26103, 09/07/2025: 26364, 09/14/2025: 27147, 09/21/2025: 26886, 09/28/2025: 26364, 10/05/2025: 27147, 10/12/2025: 27669, 10/19/2025: 26886, 10/26/2025: 26625, 11/02/2025: 26886, 11/09/2025: 26625, 11/16/2025: 25581, 11/23/2025: 25842, 11/30/2025: 26103, 12/07/2025: 25581, 12/14/2025: 25320, 12/21/2025: 26625, 12/28/2025: 27408, 01/04/2026: 27408, 01/11/2026: 28191, 01/18/2026: 29757, 01/25/2026: 29757, 02/01/2026: 28974, 02/08/2026: 29235, 02/15/2026: 29757, 02/22/2026: 28713, 03/01/2026: 28452, 03/08/2026: 29235, 03/15/2026: 29235, 03/22/2026: 28191, 03/29/2026: 28452, 04/05/2026: 28974, 04/12/2026: 28191, 04/19/2026: 27147, 04/26/2026: 27669, 05/03/2026: 27930, 05/10/2026: 26886, 05/17/2026: 26886"

"Torii","A traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at the entrance of or within a Shinto shrine, symbolizing the transition from the mundane to the sacred. The Torii serves as a marker where kami (spirits or gods) are welcomed and thought to travel through, often featuring a simple yet elegant design that includes two vertical pillars and a horizontal crossbar.

"Box breathing","Box breathing is a relaxation technique that involves a structured pattern of inhaling, holding the breath, exhaling, and holding the breath again, each for a count of four. This method is used to reduce stress, enhance focus, and promote a sense of calm by regulating the breath and activating the body's parasympathetic nervous system. Box breathing is particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, or those seeking to improve their concentration and mental clarity.","health,lifestyle,fitness,mental-health,healthcare","No","+9%",60500,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/box-breathing","Facebook: 0.70, Instagram: 0.81, LinkedIn: 0.63, Pinterest: 0.78, Reddit: 0.66, TikTok: 0.71, Twitter: 0.63, YouTube: 0.82","12/01/2024: 12911, 12/08/2024: 12911, 12/15/2024: 12083, 12/22/2024: 8276, 12/29/2024: 11917, 01/05/2025: 13573, 01/12/2025: 12414, 01/19/2025: 13076, 01/26/2025: 13738, 02/02/2025: 16552, 02/09/2025: 16221, 02/16/2025: 15228, 02/23/2025: 13738, 03/02/2025: 15725, 03/09/2025: 14897, 03/16/2025: 15393, 03/23/2025: 12911, 03/30/2025: 13242, 04/06/2025: 14566, 04/13/2025: 13573, 04/20/2025: 13738, 04/27/2025: 14235, 05/04/2025: 15228, 05/11/2025: 14897, 05/18/2025: 15393, 05/25/2025: 14069, 06/08/2025: 14235, 06/15/2025: 14069, 06/22/2025: 14069, 06/29/2025: 14069, 07/06/2025: 14235, 07/13/2025: 14400, 07/20/2025: 14566, 07/27/2025: 14566, 08/03/2025: 14731, 08/10/2025: 14897, 08/17/2025: 15062, 08/24/2025: 15228, 08/31/2025: 15062, 09/07/2025: 15062, 09/14/2025: 15062, 09/21/2025: 14897, 09/28/2025: 14897, 10/05/2025: 14731, 10/12/2025: 14731, 10/19/2025: 14566, 10/26/2025: 14566, 11/02/2025: 14566, 11/09/2025: 14400, 11/16/2025: 14235, 11/23/2025: 13904, 11/30/2025: 13407, 12/07/2025: 13242, 12/14/2025: 13076, 12/21/2025: 12911, 12/28/2025: 13076, 01/04/2026: 13242, 01/11/2026: 13573, 01/18/2026: 13738, 01/25/2026: 13904, 02/01/2026: 14069, 02/08/2026: 14069, 02/15/2026: 13904, 02/22/2026: 13738, 03/01/2026: 13573, 03/08/2026: 13407, 03/15/2026: 13076, 03/22/2026: 13076, 03/29/2026: 12911, 04/05/2026: 12911, 04/12/2026: 12911, 04/19/2026: 13076, 04/26/2026: 13076, 05/03/2026: 12911, 05/10/2026: 12911, 05/17/2026: 12745"

"Circular economy","An economic system focused on eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through principles like designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. This approach contrasts with the traditional linear economy by emphasizing reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling to create a closed-loop system, thereby reducing environmental impact and resource consumption. The circular economy primarily benefits businesses, policymakers, and environmental advocates aiming to promote sustainable development and resource efficiency.","business,industry,lifestyle,manufacturing,energy,eco","No","+3%",74000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Stationary","Past 6 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/circular-economy-1","Facebook: 0.93, Instagram: 0.92, LinkedIn: 1.00, Pinterest: 0.86, Reddit: 0.70, TikTok: 0.64, Twitter: 0.98, YouTube: 0.96","12/01/2024: 16629, 12/08/2024: 17015, 12/15/2024: 14502, 12/22/2024: 7541, 12/29/2024: 8507, 01/05/2025: 13922, 01/12/2025: 17015, 01/19/2025: 16629, 01/26/2025: 17015, 02/02/2025: 18176, 02/09/2025: 19336, 02/16/2025: 18756, 02/23/2025: 18949, 03/02/2025: 18756, 03/09/2025: 18369, 03/16/2025: 18756, 03/23/2025: 17982, 03/30/2025: 17596, 04/06/2025: 16049, 04/13/2025: 14695, 04/20/2025: 15855, 04/27/2025: 17015, 05/04/2025: 16629, 05/11/2025: 17596, 05/18/2025: 16435, 05/25/2025: 17209, 06/08/2025: 15662, 06/15/2025: 15275, 06/22/2025: 14888, 06/29/2025: 14502, 07/06/2025: 14115, 07/13/2025: 13922, 07/20/2025: 13728, 07/27/2025: 13728, 08/03/2025: 13922, 08/10/2025: 14695, 08/17/2025: 15469, 08/24/2025: 16629, 08/31/2025: 17596, 09/07/2025: 18369, 09/14/2025: 18756, 09/21/2025: 18949, 09/28/2025: 18756, 10/05/2025: 18369, 10/12/2025: 18369, 10/19/2025: 18176, 10/26/2025: 18369, 11/02/2025: 18176, 11/09/2025: 18176, 11/16/2025: 17596, 11/23/2025: 16435, 11/30/2025: 15275, 12/07/2025: 13922, 12/14/2025: 12955, 12/21/2025: 12761, 12/28/2025: 12761, 01/04/2026: 13342, 01/11/2026: 13922, 01/18/2026: 14888, 01/25/2026: 15469, 02/01/2026: 16242, 02/08/2026: 16629, 02/15/2026: 17015, 02/22/2026: 17402, 03/01/2026: 17402, 03/08/2026: 17209, 03/15/2026: 17015, 03/22/2026: 16629, 03/29/2026: 16049, 04/05/2026: 15662, 04/12/2026: 15082, 04/19/2026: 14695, 04/26/2026: 14308, 05/03/2026: 14115, 05/10/2026: 14115"
