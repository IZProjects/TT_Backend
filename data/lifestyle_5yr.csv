This method is commonly used by students who are under time constraints or have procrastinated their study efforts.","lifestyle,education",No,1000%,135000,Peaked,Stationary,Low,Average,Negative,Declining,Past 5 years,https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cramming,"Facebook: 0.82, Instagram: 0.89, LinkedIn: 0.64, Pinterest: 0.74, Reddit: 0.85, TikTok: 0.88, Twitter: 0.92, YouTube: 0.82","06/01/2020: 0, 07/01/2020: 0, 08/01/2020: 0, 09/01/2020: 0, 10/01/2020: 0, 11/01/2020: 0, 12/01/2020: 0, 01/01/2021: 0, 02/01/2021: 135000, 03/01/2021: 503181, 04/01/2021: 454090, 05/01/2021: 405000, 06/01/2021: 392727, 07/01/2021: 441818, 08/01/2021: 429545, 09/01/2021: 355909, 10/01/2021: 576818, 11/01/2021: 368181, 12/01/2021: 429545, 01/01/2022: 515454, 02/01/2022: 171818, 03/01/2022: 417272, 04/01/2022: 490909, 05/01/2022: 515454, 06/01/2022: 515454, 07/01/2022: 576818, 08/01/2022: 527727, 09/01/2022: 417272, 10/01/2022: 306818, 11/01/2022: 650454, 12/01/2022: 724090, 01/01/2023: 687272, 02/01/2023: 625909, 03/01/2023: 306818, 04/01/2023: 270000, 05/01/2023: 147272, 06/01/2023: 294545, 07/01/2023: 294545, 08/01/2023: 331363, 09/01/2023: 233181, 10/01/2023: 233181, 11/01/2023: 257727, 12/01/2023: 171818, 01/01/2024: 159545, 02/01/2024: 159545, 03/01/2024: 196363, 04/01/2024: 208636, 05/01/2024: 490909, 06/01/2024: 1202727, 07/01/2024: 1227272, 08/01/2024: 650454, 09/01/2024: 895909, 10/01/2024: 466363, 11/01/2024: 306818, 12/01/2024: 282272, 01/01/2025: 196363, 02/01/2025: 135000, 03/01/2025: 110454, 04/01/2025: 135000, 05/01/2025: 135000, 06/01/2025: 503653, 07/01/2025: 451730, 08/01/2025: 373846, 09/01/2025: 332307, 10/01/2025: 218076, 11/01/2025: 157846, 12/01/2025: 124615, 01/01/2026: 57115, 02/01/2026: 31153, 03/01/2026: 20769, 04/01/2026: 41538, 05/01/2026: 72692"

Chemical recycling,"Process that converts plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels by breaking down plastics at the molecular level. Chemical recycling includes methods such as pyrolysis, gasification, and depolymerization, which can handle a wider range of plastic waste and produce higher-quality recycled materials compared to mechanical recycling, though it is often more energy-intensive and expensive. This process is particularly beneficial for industries and organizations focused on sustainable waste management and reducing plastic pollution.","eco,science,industry,lifestyle,manufacturing,gardening-agriculture",No,122%,2400,Exploding,Exponential,High,Low,Negative,Declining,Past 5 years,https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/chemical-recycling,"Facebook: 0.47, Instagram: 0.42, LinkedIn: 0.77, Pinterest: 0.40, Reddit: 0.42, TikTok: 0.21, Twitter: 0.64, YouTube: 0.53","06/01/2020: 1080, 07/01/2020: 1128, 08/01/2020: 1104, 09/01/2020: 1392, 10/01/2020: 1320, 11/01/2020: 1200, 12/01/2020: 1128, 01/01/2021: 1104, 02/01/2021: 1248, 03/01/2021: 1368, 04/01/2021: 1200, 05/01/2021: 1296, 06/01/2021: 1368, 07/01/2021: 1008, 08/01/2021: 1032, 09/01/2021: 1248, 10/01/2021: 1392, 11/01/2021: 1416, 12/01/2021: 1104, 01/01/2022: 1512, 02/01/2022: 1728, 03/01/2022: 1800, 04/01/2022: 1824, 05/01/2022: 1704, 06/01/2022: 1728, 07/01/2022: 1224, 08/01/2022: 1224, 09/01/2022: 1488, 10/01/2022: 1824, 11/01/2022: 1656, 12/01/2022: 1440, 01/01/2023: 1608, 02/01/2023: 1824, 03/01/2023: 1728, 04/01/2023: 1584, 05/01/2023: 1776, 06/01/2023: 1488, 07/01/2023: 1176, 08/01/2023: 1296, 09/01/2023: 1752, 10/01/2023: 1752, 11/01/2023: 1704, 12/01/2023: 1416, 01/01/2024: 1656, 02/01/2024: 1728, 03/01/2024: 1872, 04/01/2024: 1872, 05/01/2024: 1920, 06/01/2024: 1536, 07/01/2024: 1464, 08/01/2024: 1464, 09/01/2024: 1920, 10/01/2024: 1992, 11/01/2024: 1944, 12/01/2024: 1752, 01/01/2025: 1680, 02/01/2025: 2256, 03/01/2025: 2304, 04/01/2025: 2400, 05/01/2025: 2400, 06/01/2025: 2112, 07/01/2025: 1892, 08/01/2025: 1967, 09/01/2025: 2157, 10/01/2025: 2134, 11/01/2025: 1973, 12/01/2025: 1730, 01/01/2026: 1737, 02/01/2026: 1862, 03/01/2026: 1866, 04/01/2026: 1811, 05/01/2026: 1796"
Generational trauma,"The transmission of trauma from one generation to the next, often referred to as intergenerational trauma, involves the passing down of traumatic experiences through genetic, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms. This concept suggests that the effects of trauma experienced by one generation can influence the health, behavior, and well-being of subsequent generations, potentially leading to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Generational trauma is particularly relevant to communities and families affected by large-scale historical events such as slavery, the Holocaust, colonization, and war.","health,industry,lifestyle,mental-health,healthcare,education",No,122%,49500,Regular,Accelerating,Low,Low,Negative,Growing,Past 5 years,https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/generational-trauma,"Facebook: 0.71, Instagram: 0.87, LinkedIn: 0.69, Pinterest: 0.75, Reddit: 0.73, TikTok: 0.91, Twitter: 0.80, YouTube: 0.82","06/01/2020: 22335, 07/01/2020: 13884, 08/01/2020: 13280, 09/01/2020: 15091, 10/01/2020: 15091, 11/01/2020: 11469, 12/01/2020: 12676, 01/01/2021: 12676, 02/01/2021: 15695, 03/01/2021: 16298, 04/01/2021: 16298, 05/01/2021: 16298, 06/01/2021: 16298, 07/01/2021: 17506, 08/01/2021: 16902, 09/01/2021: 16298, 10/01/2021: 20524, 11/01/2021: 18713, 12/01/2021: 27164, 01/01/2022: 43463, 02/01/2022: 41048, 03/01/2022: 49500, 04/01/2022: 48896, 05/01/2022: 48292, 06/01/2022: 38030, 07/01/2022: 32597, 08/01/2022: 35012, 09/01/2022: 45878, 10/01/2022: 47085, 11/01/2022: 39841, 12/01/2022: 41652, 01/01/2023: 44670, 02/01/2023: 45274, 03/01/2023: 47085, 04/01/2023: 47689, 05/01/2023: 41652, 06/01/2023: 42256, 07/01/2023: 33804, 08/01/2023: 34408, 09/01/2023: 39237, 10/01/2023: 37426, 11/01/2023: 60365, 12/01/2023: 43463, 01/01/2024: 39237, 02/01/2024: 44670, 03/01/2024: 46481, 04/01/2024: 46481, 05/01/2024: 40445, 06/01/2024: 47085, 07/01/2024: 48292, 08/01/2024: 47085, 09/01/2024: 43463, 10/01/2024: 48896, 11/01/2024: 45274, 12/01/2024: 45878, 01/01/2025: 41652, 02/01/2025: 45274, 03/01/2025: 47689, 04/01/2025: 47085, 05/01/2025: 49500, 06/01/2025: 46961, 07/01/2025: 43788, 08/01/2025: 47046, 09/01/2025: 43576, 10/01/2025: 50346, 11/01/2025: 46200, 12/01/2025: 47384, 01/01/2026: 47173, 02/01/2026: 48442, 03/01/2026: 51107, 04/01/2026: 47173, 05/01/2026: 53025"

Lofi music primarily appeals to individuals seeking a soothing auditory environment, particularly students and professionals looking for focus-enhancing background music.","entertainment,lifestyle,streaming,social-media,art,productivity,workplace",No,119%,49500,Regular,Accelerating,Medium,Low,Positive,Growing,Past 5 years,https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/lofi-music,"Facebook: 0.74, Instagram: 0.80, LinkedIn: 0.50, Pinterest: 0.84, Reddit: 0.81, TikTok: 0.92, Twitter: 0.81, YouTube: 1.00","06/01/2020: 22578, 07/01/2020: 21710, 08/01/2020: 26052, 09/01/2020: 35605, 10/01/2020: 26052, 11/01/2020: 24315, 12/01/2020: 26052, 01/01/2021: 30394, 02/01/2021: 30394, 03/01/2021: 32131, 04/01/2021: 33000, 05/01/2021: 35605, 06/01/2021: 33000, 07/01/2021: 33000, 08/01/2021: 32131, 09/01/2021: 39947, 10/01/2021: 37342, 11/01/2021: 34736, 12/01/2021: 36473, 01/01/2022: 48631, 02/01/2022: 51236, 03/01/2022: 52105, 04/01/2022: 49500, 05/01/2022: 48631, 06/01/2022: 46026, 07/01/2022: 44289, 08/01/2022: 45157, 09/01/2022: 47763, 10/01/2022: 48631, 11/01/2022: 48631, 12/01/2022: 51236, 01/01/2023: 54710, 02/01/2023: 66868, 03/01/2023: 86842, 04/01/2023: 68605, 05/01/2023: 49500, 06/01/2023: 47763, 07/01/2023: 47763, 08/01/2023: 47763, 09/01/2023: 52973, 10/01/2023: 47763, 11/01/2023: 45157, 12/01/2023: 45157, 01/01/2024: 47763, 02/01/2024: 52973, 03/01/2024: 46026, 04/01/2024: 45157, 05/01/2024: 44289, 06/01/2024: 39947, 07/01/2024: 36473, 08/01/2024: 42552, 09/01/2024: 51236, 10/01/2024: 49500, 11/01/2024: 48631, 12/01/2024: 47763, 01/01/2025: 51236, 02/01/2025: 57315, 03/01/2025: 49500, 04/01/2025: 48631, 05/01/2025: 49500, 06/01/2025: 44343, 07/01/2025: 44049, 08/01/2025: 46671, 09/01/2025: 51267, 10/01/2025: 48910, 11/01/2025: 46671, 12/01/2025: 46258, 01/01/2026: 49941, 02/01/2026: 54950, 03/01/2026: 55982, 04/01/2026: 54361, 05/01/2026: 53035"

Covert incest primarily affects children who are placed in inappropriate emotional roles by their parents, leading to long-term emotional and psychological challenges.","health,lifestyle,mental-health,education",No,67%,0,Regular,Accelerating,Low,Low,Negative,Stationary,Past 5 years,https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/covert-incest,"Facebook: 0.17, Instagram: 0.31, LinkedIn: 0.15, Pinterest: 0.16, Reddit: 0.64, TikTok: 0.39, Twitter: 0.22, YouTube: 0.33","06/01/2020: 29, 07/01/2020: 32, 08/01/2020: 34, 09/01/2020: 35, 10/01/2020: 32, 11/01/2020: 33, 12/01/2020: 45, 01/01/2021: 43, 02/01/2021: 35, 03/01/2021: 29, 04/01/2021: 44, 05/01/2021: 40, 06/01/2021: 39, 07/01/2021: 100, 08/01/2021: 59, 09/01/2021: 53, 10/01/2021: 81, 11/01/2021: 83, 12/01/2021: 65, 01/01/2022: 60, 02/01/2022: 45, 03/01/2022: 48, 04/01/2022: 72, 05/01/2022: 53, 06/01/2022: 60, 07/01/2022: 61, 08/01/2022: 46, 09/01/2022: 46, 10/01/2022: 86, 11/01/2022: 49, 12/01/2022: 54, 01/01/2023: 49, 02/01/2023: 55, 03/01/2023: 51, 04/01/2023: 55, 05/01/2023: 45, 06/01/2023: 49, 07/01/2023: 58, 08/01/2023: 61, 09/01/2023: 62, 10/01/2023: 60, 11/01/2023: 54, 12/01/2023: 59, 01/01/2024: 54, 02/01/2024: 53, 03/01/2024: 59, 04/01/2024: 61, 05/01/2024: 51, 06/01/2024: 60, 07/01/2024: 59, 08/01/2024: 53, 09/01/2024: 44, 10/01/2024: 45, 11/01/2024: 48, 12/01/2024: 51, 01/01/2025: 59, 02/01/2025: 45, 03/01/2025: 43, 04/01/2025: 43, 05/01/2025: 49, 06/01/2025: 47, 07/01/2025: 47, 08/01/2025: 43, 09/01/2025: 41, 10/01/2025: 52, 11/01/2025: 47, 12/01/2025: 45, 01/01/2026: 49, 02/01/2026: 39, 03/01/2026: 40, 04/01/2026: 43, 05/01/2026: 49"

freebirth,"Freebirth, also known as unassisted childbirth, is the process of intentionally giving birth without the assistance of a medical birth attendant, such as a doctor or midwife.
