Lip stain masques are primarily targeted at individuals seeking durable, low-maintenance lip color that lasts throughout the day without frequent reapplication.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,cpg","No","+4400%",590,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Positive","Declining","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/lip-stain-masque","Facebook: 0.35, Instagram: 0.43, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.66, Reddit: 0.18, TikTok: 0.65, Twitter: 0.07, YouTube: 0.44","05/26/2024: 0, 06/02/2024: 0, 06/09/2024: 158, 06/16/2024: 0, 06/23/2024: 0, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 0, 07/14/2024: 0, 07/21/2024: 207, 07/28/2024: 0, 08/04/2024: 195, 08/11/2024: 0, 08/18/2024: 158, 08/25/2024: 207, 09/01/2024: 0, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 143, 09/22/2024: 228, 09/29/2024: 146, 10/06/2024: 158, 10/13/2024: 0, 10/20/2024: 189, 10/27/2024: 0, 11/03/2024: 189, 11/10/2024: 155, 11/17/2024: 173, 11/24/2024: 173, 12/01/2024: 280, 12/08/2024: 268, 12/15/2024: 170, 12/22/2024: 237, 12/29/2024: 304, 01/05/2025: 231, 01/12/2025: 201, 01/19/2025: 164, 01/26/2025: 225, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 158, 02/16/2025: 182, 02/23/2025: 158, 03/02/2025: 292, 03/09/2025: 0, 03/16/2025: 237, 03/23/2025: 222, 03/30/2025: 167, 04/06/2025: 210, 04/13/2025: 222, 04/20/2025: 167, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 250, 05/11/2025: 137, 05/18/2025: 137, 06/08/2025: 207, 06/15/2025: 125, 06/22/2025: 201, 06/29/2025: 109, 07/06/2025: 173, 07/13/2025: 143, 07/20/2025: 161, 07/27/2025: 201, 08/03/2025: 143, 08/10/2025: 234, 08/17/2025: 128, 08/24/2025: 192, 08/31/2025: 121, 09/07/2025: 121, 09/14/2025: 112, 09/21/2025: 76, 09/28/2025: 103, 10/05/2025: 54, 10/12/2025: 91, 10/19/2025: 60, 10/26/2025: 88, 11/02/2025: 88, 11/09/2025: 79, 11/16/2025: 125, 11/23/2025: 82, 11/30/2025: 152, 12/07/2025: 103, 12/14/2025: 143, 12/21/2025: 128, 12/28/2025: 115, 01/04/2026: 143, 01/11/2026: 82, 01/18/2026: 118, 01/25/2026: 64, 02/01/2026: 73, 02/08/2026: 42, 02/15/2026: 24, 02/22/2026: 21, 03/01/2026: 15, 03/08/2026: 24, 03/15/2026: 21, 03/22/2026: 42, 03/29/2026: 33, 04/05/2026: 36, 04/12/2026: 42, 04/19/2026: 21, 04/26/2026: 24, 05/03/2026: 12, 05/10/2026: 12, 05/17/2026: 9"

"Microneedle Patches ","Microneedle patches are a relatively recent development in medical technology, designed to deliver drugs or vaccines through the skin in a minimally invasive way. They consist of an array of tiny needles, often made from materials like silicon, metal, or polymers, which are small enough to avoid causing pain but large enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin. This method can improve the delivery of medications by bypassing the digestive system and directly entering the bloodstream, potentially increasing the efficacy and speed of drug delivery.","beauty,skincare,health,makeup-cosmetics,personal-care,cpg","No","+187%",6600,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/microneedle-patches-1","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.50, LinkedIn: 0.34, Pinterest: 0.51, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.59, Twitter: 0.36, YouTube: 0.40","05/26/2024: 535, 06/02/2024: 731, 06/09/2024: 588, 06/16/2024: 713, 06/23/2024: 749, 06/30/2024: 553, 07/07/2024: 1070, 07/14/2024: 660, 07/21/2024: 1035, 07/28/2024: 820, 08/04/2024: 767, 08/11/2024: 749, 08/18/2024: 856, 08/25/2024: 678, 09/01/2024: 481, 09/08/2024: 588, 09/15/2024: 588, 09/22/2024: 713, 09/29/2024: 696, 10/06/2024: 785, 10/13/2024: 696, 10/20/2024: 785, 10/27/2024: 624, 11/03/2024: 1499, 11/10/2024: 963, 11/17/2024: 785, 11/24/2024: 1070, 12/01/2024: 874, 12/08/2024: 963, 12/15/2024: 767, 12/22/2024: 1035, 12/29/2024: 749, 01/05/2025: 928, 01/12/2025: 910, 01/19/2025: 910, 01/26/2025: 910, 02/02/2025: 838, 02/09/2025: 713, 02/16/2025: 660, 02/23/2025: 571, 03/02/2025: 874, 03/09/2025: 981, 03/16/2025: 981, 03/23/2025: 1106, 03/30/2025: 1392, 04/06/2025: 1552, 04/13/2025: 1570, 04/20/2025: 1534, 04/27/2025: 1463, 05/04/2025: 1302, 05/11/2025: 1231, 05/18/2025: 1534, 06/08/2025: 1570, 06/15/2025: 1534, 06/22/2025: 1624, 06/29/2025: 1570, 07/06/2025: 1677, 07/13/2025: 1588, 07/20/2025: 1695, 07/27/2025: 1641, 08/03/2025: 1695, 08/10/2025: 1677, 08/17/2025: 1695, 08/24/2025: 1713, 08/31/2025: 1677, 09/07/2025: 1766, 09/14/2025: 1695, 09/21/2025: 1802, 09/28/2025: 1731, 10/05/2025: 1873, 10/12/2025: 1820, 10/19/2025: 1963, 10/26/2025: 1963, 11/02/2025: 2070, 11/09/2025: 2106, 11/16/2025: 2088, 11/23/2025: 2123, 11/30/2025: 2016, 12/07/2025: 2070, 12/14/2025: 1927, 12/21/2025: 2052, 12/28/2025: 1963, 01/04/2026: 2123, 01/11/2026: 2070, 01/18/2026: 2177, 01/25/2026: 2159, 02/01/2026: 2159, 02/08/2026: 2177, 02/15/2026: 2123, 02/22/2026: 2195, 03/01/2026: 2106, 03/08/2026: 2266, 03/15/2026: 2177, 03/22/2026: 2373, 03/29/2026: 2302, 04/05/2026: 2480, 04/12/2026: 2480, 04/19/2026: 2587, 04/26/2026: 2623, 05/03/2026: 2587, 05/10/2026: 2623, 05/17/2026: 2480"

Jet lag masks are ideal for frequent travelers, individuals with disrupted sleep schedules, or anyone looking to combat fatigue-related skin issues and maintain a healthy, radiant complexion.","travel,beauty,skincare,cpg","No","+155%",6600,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","High","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/jet-lag-mask","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.58, LinkedIn: 0.11, Pinterest: 0.69, Reddit: 0.52, TikTok: 0.69, Twitter: 0.19, YouTube: 0.46","06/02/2024: 601, 06/09/2024: 725, 06/16/2024: 767, 06/23/2024: 788, 06/30/2024: 767, 07/07/2024: 808, 07/14/2024: 1016, 07/21/2024: 705, 07/28/2024: 663, 08/04/2024: 705, 08/11/2024: 560, 08/18/2024: 746, 08/25/2024: 663, 09/01/2024: 663, 09/08/2024: 746, 09/15/2024: 518, 09/22/2024: 580, 09/29/2024: 601, 10/06/2024: 767, 10/13/2024: 601, 10/20/2024: 580, 10/27/2024: 1057, 11/03/2024: 829, 11/10/2024: 1161, 11/17/2024: 974, 11/24/2024: 1140, 12/01/2024: 1555, 12/08/2024: 1223, 12/15/2024: 1099, 12/22/2024: 1534, 12/29/2024: 2074, 01/05/2025: 1908, 01/12/2025: 1617, 01/19/2025: 1493, 01/26/2025: 1638, 02/02/2025: 1597, 02/09/2025: 1306, 02/16/2025: 1742, 02/23/2025: 1223, 03/02/2025: 1721, 03/09/2025: 1763, 03/16/2025: 1638, 03/23/2025: 1576, 03/30/2025: 1576, 04/06/2025: 1659, 04/13/2025: 1680, 04/20/2025: 1534, 04/27/2025: 1389, 05/04/2025: 1638, 05/11/2025: 1493, 05/18/2025: 1368, 05/25/2025: 1534, 06/08/2025: 1493, 06/15/2025: 1514, 06/22/2025: 1493, 06/29/2025: 1493, 07/06/2025: 1534, 07/13/2025: 1514, 07/20/2025: 1514, 07/27/2025: 1576, 08/03/2025: 1555, 08/10/2025: 1555, 08/17/2025: 1597, 08/24/2025: 1555, 08/31/2025: 1576, 09/07/2025: 1617, 09/14/2025: 1576, 09/21/2025: 1597, 09/28/2025: 1638, 10/05/2025: 1638, 10/12/2025: 1680, 10/19/2025: 1742, 10/26/2025: 1763, 11/02/2025: 1825, 11/09/2025: 1928, 11/16/2025: 1928, 11/23/2025: 1991, 11/30/2025: 2094, 12/07/2025: 2094, 12/14/2025: 2115, 12/21/2025: 2198, 12/28/2025: 2177, 01/04/2026: 2198, 01/11/2026: 2260, 01/18/2026: 2219, 01/25/2026: 2219, 02/01/2026: 2260, 02/08/2026: 2219, 02/15/2026: 2219, 02/22/2026: 2260, 03/01/2026: 2177, 03/08/2026: 2177, 03/15/2026: 2219, 03/22/2026: 2177, 03/29/2026: 2198, 04/05/2026: 2260, 04/12/2026: 2260, 04/19/2026: 2302, 04/26/2026: 2385, 05/03/2026: 2343, 05/10/2026: 2364"

This product is particularly popular among individuals looking to achieve a refreshed and awake appearance without heavy makeup.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare,cpg","No","+91%",12100,"Exploding","Exponential","Medium","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/under-eye-brightener","Facebook: 0.59, Instagram: 0.62, LinkedIn: 0.11, Pinterest: 0.74, Reddit: 0.50, TikTok: 0.79, Twitter: 0.22, YouTube: 0.55","06/02/2024: 1476, 06/09/2024: 1845, 06/16/2024: 1983, 06/23/2024: 1476, 06/30/2024: 1245, 07/07/2024: 1199, 07/14/2024: 1337, 07/21/2024: 1245, 07/28/2024: 1153, 08/04/2024: 1199, 08/11/2024: 1245, 08/18/2024: 1383, 08/25/2024: 1568, 09/01/2024: 1614, 09/08/2024: 1430, 09/15/2024: 1014, 09/22/2024: 1430, 09/29/2024: 1522, 10/06/2024: 1291, 10/13/2024: 1337, 10/20/2024: 1107, 10/27/2024: 1568, 11/03/2024: 2260, 11/10/2024: 1891, 11/17/2024: 1522, 11/24/2024: 1660, 12/01/2024: 2214, 12/08/2024: 1983, 12/15/2024: 4613, 12/22/2024: 4151, 12/29/2024: 2860, 01/05/2025: 2813, 01/12/2025: 2998, 01/19/2025: 2721, 01/26/2025: 2214, 02/02/2025: 2398, 02/09/2025: 2767, 02/16/2025: 2537, 02/23/2025: 3874, 03/02/2025: 3644, 03/09/2025: 3044, 03/16/2025: 2860, 03/23/2025: 2721, 03/30/2025: 2721, 04/06/2025: 3552, 04/13/2025: 3321, 04/20/2025: 3229, 04/27/2025: 2352, 05/04/2025: 2398, 05/11/2025: 2583, 05/18/2025: 2352, 05/25/2025: 2813, 06/08/2025: 1752, 06/15/2025: 1706, 06/22/2025: 1752, 06/29/2025: 1522, 07/06/2025: 1383, 07/13/2025: 1522, 07/20/2025: 1476, 07/27/2025: 1337, 08/03/2025: 1522, 08/10/2025: 1568, 08/17/2025: 1430, 08/24/2025: 1476, 08/31/2025: 1614, 09/07/2025: 1476, 09/14/2025: 1430, 09/21/2025: 1614, 09/28/2025: 1568, 10/05/2025: 1430, 10/12/2025: 1614, 10/19/2025: 1660, 10/26/2025: 1522, 11/02/2025: 1614, 11/09/2025: 1845, 11/16/2025: 1891, 11/23/2025: 2029, 11/30/2025: 2491, 12/07/2025: 2675, 12/14/2025: 2629, 12/21/2025: 3044, 12/28/2025: 3182, 01/04/2026: 2813, 01/11/2026: 2952, 01/18/2026: 3229, 01/25/2026: 2906, 02/01/2026: 2952, 02/08/2026: 3367, 02/15/2026: 3275, 02/22/2026: 3090, 03/01/2026: 3552, 03/08/2026: 3690, 03/15/2026: 3367, 03/22/2026: 3598, 03/29/2026: 3874, 04/05/2026: 3459, 04/12/2026: 3367, 04/19/2026: 3690, 04/26/2026: 3321, 05/03/2026: 2998, 05/10/2026: 3136, 05/17/2026: 2998"

"Liquid exfoliant","Skincare products designed to remove dead skin cells from the surface of the skin using chemical agents. Unlike physical exfoliants, liquid exfoliants dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be easily washed away, and they often contain ingredients like Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs), and Polyhydroxy Acids (PHAs). These products are beneficial for individuals looking to improve skin texture, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, unclog pores, and enhance overall skin radiance.","beauty,health,skincare,personal-care,cpg","No","+81%",4400,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/liquid-exfoliant","Facebook: 0.63, Instagram: 0.78, LinkedIn: 0.20, Pinterest: 0.73, Reddit: 0.68, TikTok: 0.73, Twitter: 0.37, YouTube: 0.57","06/02/2024: 564, 06/09/2024: 717, 06/16/2024: 529, 06/23/2024: 529, 06/30/2024: 552, 07/07/2024: 517, 07/14/2024: 564, 07/21/2024: 623, 07/28/2024: 493, 08/04/2024: 529, 08/11/2024: 493, 08/18/2024: 599, 08/25/2024: 564, 09/01/2024: 670, 09/08/2024: 541, 09/15/2024: 529, 09/22/2024: 505, 09/29/2024: 552, 10/06/2024: 646, 10/13/2024: 541, 10/20/2024: 482, 10/27/2024: 599, 11/03/2024: 599, 11/10/2024: 811, 11/17/2024: 693, 11/24/2024: 870, 12/01/2024: 799, 12/08/2024: 705, 12/15/2024: 670, 12/22/2024: 870, 12/29/2024: 846, 01/05/2025: 788, 01/12/2025: 740, 01/19/2025: 776, 01/26/2025: 799, 02/02/2025: 788, 02/09/2025: 693, 02/16/2025: 858, 02/23/2025: 776, 03/02/2025: 870, 03/09/2025: 799, 03/16/2025: 893, 03/23/2025: 976, 03/30/2025: 905, 04/06/2025: 1011, 04/13/2025: 929, 04/20/2025: 1058, 04/27/2025: 1176, 05/04/2025: 964, 05/11/2025: 1011, 05/18/2025: 964, 05/25/2025: 1023, 06/08/2025: 964, 06/15/2025: 952, 06/22/2025: 964, 06/29/2025: 976, 07/06/2025: 976, 07/13/2025: 976, 07/20/2025: 999, 07/27/2025: 987, 08/03/2025: 987, 08/10/2025: 1011, 08/17/2025: 987, 08/24/2025: 987, 08/31/2025: 999, 09/07/2025: 976, 09/14/2025: 964, 09/21/2025: 964, 09/28/2025: 940, 10/05/2025: 929, 10/12/2025: 952, 10/19/2025: 940, 10/26/2025: 964, 11/02/2025: 999, 11/09/2025: 999, 11/16/2025: 1011, 11/23/2025: 1023, 11/30/2025: 999, 12/07/2025: 999, 12/14/2025: 1023, 12/21/2025: 1023, 12/28/2025: 1046, 01/04/2026: 1105, 01/11/2026: 1117, 01/18/2026: 1152, 01/25/2026: 1164, 02/01/2026: 1140, 02/08/2026: 1117, 02/15/2026: 1117, 02/22/2026: 1082, 03/01/2026: 1082, 03/08/2026: 1093, 03/15/2026: 1093, 03/22/2026: 1105, 03/29/2026: 1140, 04/05/2026: 1140, 04/12/2026: 1152, 04/19/2026: 1164, 04/26/2026: 1152, 05/03/2026: 1152, 05/10/2026: 1152"

Oil-free moisturizers are primarily targeted at individuals with oily, combination, or acne-prone skin who want effective hydration without adding excess shine or contributing to breakouts.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare,eco,cpg","No","+53%",40500,"Exploding","Exponential","Medium","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/oil-free-moisturizer","Facebook: 0.63, Instagram: 0.71, LinkedIn: 0.16, Pinterest: 0.76, Reddit: 0.57, TikTok: 0.64, Twitter: 0.22, YouTube: 0.72","06/02/2024: 6166, 06/09/2024: 5606, 06/16/2024: 6166, 06/23/2024: 7736, 06/30/2024: 6615, 07/07/2024: 6951, 07/14/2024: 7176, 07/21/2024: 7512, 07/28/2024: 4933, 08/04/2024: 5830, 08/11/2024: 6839, 08/18/2024: 6839, 08/25/2024: 5045, 09/01/2024: 6166, 09/08/2024: 4821, 09/15/2024: 8745, 09/22/2024: 5269, 09/29/2024: 6503, 10/06/2024: 7848, 10/13/2024: 5942, 10/20/2024: 7288, 10/27/2024: 6727, 11/03/2024: 7176, 11/10/2024: 6503, 11/17/2024: 8073, 11/24/2024: 7512, 12/01/2024: 6951, 12/08/2024: 8297, 12/15/2024: 6054, 12/22/2024: 6951, 12/29/2024: 6839, 01/05/2025: 7176, 01/12/2025: 7736, 01/19/2025: 7512, 01/26/2025: 8633, 02/02/2025: 6839, 02/09/2025: 7400, 02/16/2025: 7288, 02/23/2025: 8633, 03/02/2025: 8185, 03/09/2025: 7512, 03/16/2025: 8745, 03/23/2025: 8073, 03/30/2025: 11212, 04/06/2025: 9082, 04/13/2025: 8970, 04/20/2025: 9082, 04/27/2025: 9867, 05/04/2025: 10315, 05/11/2025: 9194, 05/18/2025: 9306, 05/25/2025: 9418, 06/08/2025: 8970, 06/15/2025: 8970, 06/22/2025: 8970, 06/29/2025: 8857, 07/06/2025: 8745, 07/13/2025: 8633, 07/20/2025: 8633, 07/27/2025: 8633, 08/03/2025: 8633, 08/10/2025: 8745, 08/17/2025: 8633, 08/24/2025: 8521, 08/31/2025: 8409, 09/07/2025: 8185, 09/14/2025: 8185, 09/21/2025: 8185, 09/28/2025: 8297, 10/05/2025: 8409, 10/12/2025: 8521, 10/19/2025: 8521, 10/26/2025: 8521, 11/02/2025: 8633, 11/09/2025: 8745, 11/16/2025: 8970, 11/23/2025: 8970, 11/30/2025: 8970, 12/07/2025: 8857, 12/14/2025: 8745, 12/21/2025: 8633, 12/28/2025: 8633, 01/04/2026: 8745, 01/11/2026: 8970, 01/18/2026: 9306, 01/25/2026: 9418, 02/01/2026: 9418, 02/08/2026: 9306, 02/15/2026: 9194, 02/22/2026: 9082, 03/01/2026: 9194, 03/08/2026: 9306, 03/15/2026: 9642, 03/22/2026: 9867, 03/29/2026: 9979, 04/05/2026: 9979, 04/12/2026: 9867, 04/19/2026: 9754, 04/26/2026: 9754, 05/03/2026: 9754, 05/10/2026: 9867"

It is particularly beneficial for individuals seeking tattoo removal, skin rejuvenation, and treatment of pigmented lesions.","beauty,health,skincare,personal-care,healthcare","No","+34%",74000,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/pico-laser","Facebook: 0.90, Instagram: 0.92, LinkedIn: 0.42, Pinterest: 0.57, Reddit: 0.67, TikTok: 0.88, Twitter: 0.57, YouTube: 0.77","05/26/2024: 12815, 06/02/2024: 12632, 06/09/2024: 13364, 06/16/2024: 12266, 06/23/2024: 13364, 06/30/2024: 12998, 07/07/2024: 12998, 07/14/2024: 13364, 07/21/2024: 14646, 07/28/2024: 13181, 08/04/2024: 12632, 08/11/2024: 13547, 08/18/2024: 13364, 08/25/2024: 14646, 09/01/2024: 13913, 09/08/2024: 12815, 09/15/2024: 16293, 09/22/2024: 13730, 09/29/2024: 13364, 10/06/2024: 12632, 10/13/2024: 12815, 10/20/2024: 13181, 10/27/2024: 13913, 11/03/2024: 14096, 11/10/2024: 14096, 11/17/2024: 13913, 11/24/2024: 13181, 12/01/2024: 13547, 12/08/2024: 12815, 12/15/2024: 13181, 12/22/2024: 14463, 12/29/2024: 13547, 01/05/2025: 15012, 01/12/2025: 14280, 01/19/2025: 14096, 01/26/2025: 14096, 02/02/2025: 15744, 02/09/2025: 14646, 02/16/2025: 13730, 02/23/2025: 14829, 03/02/2025: 15561, 03/09/2025: 15195, 03/16/2025: 17209, 03/23/2025: 17026, 03/30/2025: 15561, 04/06/2025: 16843, 04/13/2025: 14463, 04/20/2025: 17209, 04/27/2025: 18307, 05/04/2025: 15012, 05/11/2025: 16843, 05/18/2025: 17209, 06/08/2025: 17758, 06/15/2025: 17392, 06/22/2025: 18490, 06/29/2025: 17941, 07/06/2025: 17758, 07/13/2025: 18857, 07/20/2025: 18124, 07/27/2025: 18307, 08/03/2025: 19040, 08/10/2025: 18124, 08/17/2025: 18307, 08/24/2025: 18857, 08/31/2025: 17575, 09/07/2025: 18124, 09/14/2025: 18307, 09/21/2025: 17209, 09/28/2025: 17941, 10/05/2025: 17758, 10/12/2025: 17026, 10/19/2025: 17758, 10/26/2025: 17575, 11/02/2025: 17026, 11/09/2025: 17941, 11/16/2025: 17392, 11/23/2025: 17026, 11/30/2025: 17941, 12/07/2025: 17209, 12/14/2025: 17209, 12/21/2025: 17941, 12/28/2025: 17209, 01/04/2026: 17758, 01/11/2026: 18490, 01/18/2026: 17758, 01/25/2026: 18490, 02/01/2026: 19040, 02/08/2026: 18307, 02/15/2026: 19223, 02/22/2026: 19406, 03/01/2026: 18673, 03/08/2026: 19772, 03/15/2026: 19406, 03/22/2026: 19040, 03/29/2026: 19955, 04/05/2026: 19406, 04/12/2026: 19223, 04/19/2026: 20321, 04/26/2026: 19406, 05/03/2026: 19406, 05/10/2026: 20321"

The Russian manicure is popular among individuals seeking a highly polished and long-lasting nail appearance.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,concept","No","+21%",135000,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/russian-manicure","Facebook: 0.86, Instagram: 1.00, LinkedIn: 0.37, Pinterest: 0.98, Reddit: 0.63, TikTok: 0.97, Twitter: 0.50, YouTube: 0.71","06/02/2024: 25879, 06/09/2024: 26304, 06/16/2024: 27152, 06/23/2024: 28001, 06/30/2024: 28001, 07/07/2024: 28001, 07/14/2024: 29698, 07/21/2024: 25879, 07/28/2024: 24182, 08/04/2024: 23758, 08/11/2024: 27576, 08/18/2024: 38183, 08/25/2024: 34789, 09/01/2024: 35213, 09/08/2024: 28849, 09/15/2024: 28001, 09/22/2024: 25031, 09/29/2024: 29698, 10/06/2024: 27576, 10/13/2024: 23758, 10/20/2024: 23334, 10/27/2024: 22485, 11/03/2024: 24607, 11/10/2024: 23758, 11/17/2024: 26728, 11/24/2024: 25879, 12/01/2024: 22910, 12/08/2024: 28001, 12/15/2024: 28425, 12/22/2024: 25031, 12/29/2024: 26304, 01/05/2025: 25031, 01/12/2025: 26304, 01/19/2025: 28425, 01/26/2025: 28001, 02/02/2025: 29274, 02/09/2025: 26728, 02/16/2025: 30122, 02/23/2025: 28849, 03/02/2025: 34365, 03/09/2025: 29274, 03/16/2025: 28849, 03/23/2025: 42426, 03/30/2025: 35213, 04/06/2025: 31819, 04/13/2025: 38183, 04/20/2025: 29698, 04/27/2025: 30971, 05/04/2025: 31819, 05/11/2025: 30546, 05/18/2025: 35637, 05/25/2025: 31395, 06/08/2025: 33092, 06/15/2025: 32668, 06/22/2025: 33516, 06/29/2025: 34789, 07/06/2025: 36486, 07/13/2025: 36910, 07/20/2025: 36910, 07/27/2025: 35213, 08/03/2025: 33940, 08/10/2025: 33940, 08/17/2025: 35213, 08/24/2025: 37335, 08/31/2025: 39032, 09/07/2025: 39032, 09/14/2025: 37759, 09/21/2025: 36062, 09/28/2025: 34365, 10/05/2025: 33940, 10/12/2025: 34789, 10/19/2025: 36486, 10/26/2025: 37335, 11/02/2025: 37335, 11/09/2025: 36062, 11/16/2025: 34789, 11/23/2025: 34365, 11/30/2025: 35213, 12/07/2025: 36486, 12/14/2025: 38183, 12/21/2025: 38607, 12/28/2025: 38607, 01/04/2026: 37335, 01/11/2026: 36062, 01/18/2026: 36062, 01/25/2026: 36910, 02/01/2026: 38607, 02/08/2026: 39880, 02/15/2026: 40304, 02/22/2026: 38607, 03/01/2026: 36486, 03/08/2026: 35213, 03/15/2026: 35213, 03/22/2026: 36062, 03/29/2026: 37335, 04/05/2026: 38607, 04/12/2026: 38183, 04/19/2026: 36910, 04/26/2026: 35637, 05/03/2026: 35213, 05/10/2026: 36486, 05/17/2026: 38183"

This type of deodorant is targeted at individuals seeking a more gentle, skin-friendly alternative to traditional deodorants, especially those with sensitive skin or concerns about hyperpigmentation and ingrown hairs.","personal-care,fragrances,makeup-cosmetics,product,beauty,health,ecommerce,skincare,healthcare,cpg","No","+20%",2900,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Positive","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/aha-deodorant","Facebook: 0.27, Instagram: 0.32, LinkedIn: 0.05, Pinterest: 0.33, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.45, Twitter: 0.09, YouTube: 0.15","05/26/2024: 562, 06/02/2024: 374, 06/09/2024: 487, 06/16/2024: 487, 06/23/2024: 524, 06/30/2024: 562, 07/07/2024: 337, 07/14/2024: 374, 07/21/2024: 674, 07/28/2024: 449, 08/04/2024: 524, 08/11/2024: 337, 08/18/2024: 1086, 08/25/2024: 3746, 09/01/2024: 1611, 09/08/2024: 524, 09/15/2024: 749, 09/22/2024: 936, 09/29/2024: 1686, 10/06/2024: 936, 10/13/2024: 599, 10/20/2024: 899, 10/27/2024: 524, 11/03/2024: 749, 11/10/2024: 674, 11/17/2024: 824, 11/24/2024: 487, 12/01/2024: 524, 12/08/2024: 0, 12/15/2024: 636, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 412, 01/05/2025: 449, 01/12/2025: 449, 01/19/2025: 374, 01/26/2025: 562, 02/02/2025: 374, 02/09/2025: 524, 02/16/2025: 487, 02/23/2025: 524, 03/02/2025: 449, 03/09/2025: 3072, 03/16/2025: 2810, 03/23/2025: 786, 03/30/2025: 861, 04/06/2025: 1086, 04/13/2025: 1198, 04/20/2025: 1049, 04/27/2025: 936, 05/04/2025: 674, 05/11/2025: 711, 05/18/2025: 674, 06/08/2025: 599, 06/15/2025: 562, 06/22/2025: 487, 06/29/2025: 449, 07/06/2025: 487, 07/13/2025: 599, 07/20/2025: 749, 07/27/2025: 899, 08/03/2025: 1011, 08/10/2025: 1049, 08/17/2025: 1049, 08/24/2025: 936, 08/31/2025: 861, 09/07/2025: 786, 09/14/2025: 711, 09/21/2025: 674, 09/28/2025: 636, 10/05/2025: 636, 10/12/2025: 599, 10/19/2025: 599, 10/26/2025: 562, 11/02/2025: 524, 11/09/2025: 487, 11/16/2025: 449, 11/23/2025: 449, 11/30/2025: 412, 12/07/2025: 412, 12/14/2025: 412, 12/21/2025: 374, 12/28/2025: 374, 01/04/2026: 337, 01/11/2026: 299, 01/18/2026: 262, 01/25/2026: 224, 02/01/2026: 224, 02/08/2026: 224, 02/15/2026: 262, 02/22/2026: 337, 03/01/2026: 487, 03/08/2026: 636, 03/15/2026: 824, 03/22/2026: 974, 03/29/2026: 1049, 04/05/2026: 1049, 04/12/2026: 1011, 04/19/2026: 899, 04/26/2026: 786, 05/03/2026: 711, 05/10/2026: 674, 05/17/2026: 636"

Oil balms are primarily targeted at individuals seeking intensive hydration, particularly those with dry, sensitive, or compromised skin conditions.","eco,beauty,skincare,cpg","No","+14%",590,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/oil-balm","Facebook: 0.63, Instagram: 0.72, LinkedIn: 0.18, Pinterest: 0.79, Reddit: 0.60, TikTok: 0.74, Twitter: 0.45, YouTube: 0.58","05/19/2024: 120, 05/26/2024: 118, 06/02/2024: 116, 06/09/2024: 116, 06/16/2024: 133, 06/23/2024: 137, 06/30/2024: 127, 07/07/2024: 118, 07/14/2024: 135, 07/21/2024: 124, 07/28/2024: 125, 08/04/2024: 125, 08/11/2024: 125, 08/18/2024: 125, 08/25/2024: 133, 09/01/2024: 118, 09/08/2024: 122, 09/15/2024: 124, 09/22/2024: 118, 09/29/2024: 124, 10/06/2024: 116, 10/13/2024: 127, 10/20/2024: 137, 10/27/2024: 124, 11/03/2024: 137, 11/10/2024: 140, 11/17/2024: 156, 11/24/2024: 187, 12/01/2024: 169, 12/08/2024: 165, 12/15/2024: 163, 12/22/2024: 174, 12/29/2024: 165, 01/05/2025: 163, 01/12/2025: 154, 01/19/2025: 150, 01/26/2025: 148, 02/02/2025: 144, 02/09/2025: 148, 02/16/2025: 156, 02/23/2025: 137, 03/02/2025: 146, 03/09/2025: 133, 03/16/2025: 139, 03/23/2025: 140, 03/30/2025: 127, 04/06/2025: 146, 04/13/2025: 137, 04/20/2025: 139, 04/27/2025: 142, 05/04/2025: 140, 05/11/2025: 137, 06/08/2025: 125, 06/15/2025: 124, 06/22/2025: 127, 06/29/2025: 127, 07/06/2025: 131, 07/13/2025: 131, 07/20/2025: 135, 07/27/2025: 137, 08/03/2025: 137, 08/10/2025: 139, 08/17/2025: 137, 08/24/2025: 139, 08/31/2025: 137, 09/07/2025: 139, 09/14/2025: 137, 09/21/2025: 140, 09/28/2025: 144, 10/05/2025: 146, 10/12/2025: 152, 10/19/2025: 156, 10/26/2025: 163, 11/02/2025: 165, 11/09/2025: 176, 11/16/2025: 180, 11/23/2025: 187, 11/30/2025: 191, 12/07/2025: 197, 12/14/2025: 201, 12/21/2025: 201, 12/28/2025: 204, 01/04/2026: 201, 01/11/2026: 201, 01/18/2026: 195, 01/25/2026: 195, 02/01/2026: 193, 02/08/2026: 189, 02/15/2026: 187, 02/22/2026: 184, 03/01/2026: 182, 03/08/2026: 178, 03/15/2026: 178, 03/22/2026: 172, 03/29/2026: 174, 04/05/2026: 171, 04/12/2026: 169, 04/19/2026: 167, 04/26/2026: 165, 05/03/2026: 167, 05/10/2026: 163"

"Body neutrality","Body neutrality is a movement that encourages individuals to accept their bodies without necessarily loving or hating them. It emphasizes the functionality and capabilities of the body rather than its appearance, promoting a more neutral and less judgmental relationship with one's physical self. This approach is particularly beneficial for those who find the body positivity movement challenging, as it offers a more sustainable and less emotionally charged perspective on body image.","beauty,health,fashion,mental-health,fitness,personal-care","No","+12%",5400,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Low","Neutral","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/body-neutrality","Facebook: 0.46, Instagram: 0.65, LinkedIn: 0.43, Pinterest: 0.70, Reddit: 0.53, TikTok: 0.75, Twitter: 0.43, YouTube: 0.58","06/02/2024: 1122, 06/09/2024: 667, 06/16/2024: 774, 06/23/2024: 961, 06/30/2024: 881, 07/07/2024: 855, 07/14/2024: 1068, 07/21/2024: 694, 07/28/2024: 908, 08/04/2024: 748, 08/11/2024: 801, 08/18/2024: 1068, 08/25/2024: 935, 09/01/2024: 988, 09/08/2024: 1068, 09/15/2024: 1897, 09/22/2024: 1335, 09/29/2024: 1042, 10/06/2024: 881, 10/13/2024: 1202, 10/20/2024: 1229, 10/27/2024: 1148, 11/03/2024: 1255, 11/10/2024: 1416, 11/17/2024: 1897, 11/24/2024: 748, 12/01/2024: 1202, 12/08/2024: 988, 12/15/2024: 1095, 12/22/2024: 774, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 667, 01/12/2025: 721, 01/19/2025: 881, 01/26/2025: 1122, 02/02/2025: 1362, 02/09/2025: 1068, 02/16/2025: 1442, 02/23/2025: 1710, 03/02/2025: 2671, 03/09/2025: 1282, 03/16/2025: 1309, 03/23/2025: 2458, 03/30/2025: 1335, 04/06/2025: 1309, 04/13/2025: 1442, 04/20/2025: 1175, 04/27/2025: 1335, 05/04/2025: 855, 05/11/2025: 1629, 05/18/2025: 855, 05/25/2025: 1255, 06/08/2025: 1523, 06/15/2025: 1469, 06/22/2025: 1389, 06/29/2025: 1442, 07/06/2025: 1576, 07/13/2025: 1629, 07/20/2025: 1603, 07/27/2025: 1442, 08/03/2025: 1255, 08/10/2025: 1095, 08/17/2025: 1068, 08/24/2025: 1148, 08/31/2025: 1335, 09/07/2025: 1496, 09/14/2025: 1496, 09/21/2025: 1469, 09/28/2025: 1335, 10/05/2025: 1335, 10/12/2025: 1362, 10/19/2025: 1469, 10/26/2025: 1603, 11/02/2025: 1683, 11/09/2025: 1629, 11/16/2025: 1496, 11/23/2025: 1309, 11/30/2025: 1255, 12/07/2025: 1255, 12/14/2025: 1389, 12/21/2025: 1496, 12/28/2025: 1576, 01/04/2026: 1656, 01/11/2026: 1576, 01/18/2026: 1603, 01/25/2026: 1656, 02/01/2026: 1870, 02/08/2026: 2110, 02/15/2026: 2297, 02/22/2026: 2271, 03/01/2026: 2110, 03/08/2026: 1923, 03/15/2026: 1843, 03/22/2026: 1897, 03/29/2026: 2084, 04/05/2026: 2244, 04/12/2026: 2297, 04/19/2026: 2137, 04/26/2026: 1950, 05/03/2026: 1790, 05/10/2026: 1710"

Satin bonnets are particularly popular among individuals with natural, curly, or textured hair, as they help to maintain moisture and prevent breakage.","beauty,health,ecommerce,haircare,personal-care,cpg","No","+10%",33100,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Average","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/satin-bonnet","Facebook: 0.71, Instagram: 0.82, LinkedIn: 0.18, Pinterest: 0.95, Reddit: 0.57, TikTok: 0.88, Twitter: 0.55, YouTube: 0.68","05/26/2024: 6971, 06/02/2024: 6535, 06/09/2024: 7261, 06/16/2024: 7116, 06/23/2024: 7116, 06/30/2024: 6681, 07/07/2024: 7116, 07/14/2024: 7407, 07/21/2024: 6390, 07/28/2024: 6535, 08/04/2024: 7116, 08/11/2024: 8714, 08/18/2024: 8859, 08/25/2024: 8423, 09/01/2024: 8133, 09/08/2024: 7552, 09/15/2024: 6826, 09/22/2024: 7116, 09/29/2024: 6535, 10/06/2024: 8133, 10/13/2024: 7552, 10/20/2024: 8569, 10/27/2024: 9150, 11/03/2024: 9004, 11/10/2024: 10311, 11/17/2024: 9876, 11/24/2024: 11619, 12/01/2024: 12926, 12/08/2024: 14523, 12/15/2024: 12200, 12/22/2024: 14378, 12/29/2024: 12054, 01/05/2025: 11619, 01/12/2025: 10747, 01/19/2025: 10892, 01/26/2025: 10166, 02/02/2025: 10747, 02/09/2025: 9585, 02/16/2025: 10021, 02/23/2025: 8569, 03/02/2025: 9876, 03/09/2025: 8423, 03/16/2025: 9585, 03/23/2025: 9295, 03/30/2025: 9150, 04/06/2025: 8714, 04/13/2025: 9004, 04/20/2025: 9150, 04/27/2025: 8569, 05/04/2025: 8278, 05/11/2025: 7988, 05/18/2025: 7697, 06/08/2025: 7116, 06/15/2025: 7842, 06/22/2025: 6971, 06/29/2025: 7988, 07/06/2025: 7116, 07/13/2025: 8423, 07/20/2025: 7552, 07/27/2025: 8859, 08/03/2025: 8133, 08/10/2025: 9150, 08/17/2025: 8423, 08/24/2025: 9150, 08/31/2025: 8423, 09/07/2025: 9004, 09/14/2025: 8569, 09/21/2025: 9004, 09/28/2025: 8714, 10/05/2025: 9004, 10/12/2025: 9440, 10/19/2025: 9440, 10/26/2025: 10166, 11/02/2025: 9876, 11/09/2025: 11038, 11/16/2025: 10457, 11/23/2025: 12054, 11/30/2025: 11183, 12/07/2025: 12926, 12/14/2025: 11619, 12/21/2025: 13362, 12/28/2025: 11909, 01/04/2026: 13362, 01/11/2026: 11764, 01/18/2026: 12926, 01/25/2026: 11619, 02/01/2026: 12490, 02/08/2026: 11183, 02/15/2026: 11764, 02/22/2026: 10892, 03/01/2026: 11183, 03/08/2026: 10602, 03/15/2026: 10457, 03/22/2026: 10311, 03/29/2026: 10021, 04/05/2026: 10166, 04/12/2026: 9295, 04/19/2026: 9876, 04/26/2026: 9004, 05/03/2026: 9585, 05/10/2026: 8569, 05/17/2026: 9440"

"Ombre Brows","Semi-permanent eyebrow styling technique that uses a small machine to place fine dots of pigment into the skin, creating a soft, shaded brow pencil look. This method is applied more superficially compared to traditional tattooing, reaching only the first layer of the skin, and results in a gradient effect with lighter color at the start of the brows and darker towards the tail. Ombre Brows are ideal for individuals seeking a natural, filled-in brow appearance without the need for daily makeup application.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare","No","+1%",33100,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Positive","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/ombre-brows","Facebook: 0.93, Instagram: 1.00, LinkedIn: 0.19, Pinterest: 0.69, Reddit: 0.58, TikTok: 0.92, Twitter: 0.49, YouTube: 0.64","06/02/2024: 7612, 06/09/2024: 7868, 06/16/2024: 8125, 06/23/2024: 7184, 06/30/2024: 7184, 07/07/2024: 7612, 07/14/2024: 7697, 07/21/2024: 8381, 07/28/2024: 7270, 08/04/2024: 6927, 08/11/2024: 8552, 08/18/2024: 7441, 08/25/2024: 6927, 09/01/2024: 6671, 09/08/2024: 6414, 09/15/2024: 6585, 09/22/2024: 5644, 09/29/2024: 6927, 10/06/2024: 6842, 10/13/2024: 6414, 10/20/2024: 7013, 10/27/2024: 6842, 11/03/2024: 6500, 11/10/2024: 7868, 11/17/2024: 6842, 11/24/2024: 7612, 12/01/2024: 6756, 12/08/2024: 6072, 12/15/2024: 6756, 12/22/2024: 5901, 12/29/2024: 7783, 01/05/2025: 8039, 01/12/2025: 7441, 01/19/2025: 7697, 01/26/2025: 7868, 02/02/2025: 7098, 02/09/2025: 6500, 02/16/2025: 7355, 02/23/2025: 7783, 03/02/2025: 7270, 03/09/2025: 7783, 03/16/2025: 8381, 03/23/2025: 8552, 03/30/2025: 8210, 04/06/2025: 7954, 04/13/2025: 7612, 04/20/2025: 7270, 04/27/2025: 8296, 05/04/2025: 7954, 05/11/2025: 7783, 05/18/2025: 6927, 05/25/2025: 7697, 06/08/2025: 7868, 06/15/2025: 7868, 06/22/2025: 7441, 06/29/2025: 8210, 07/06/2025: 7697, 07/13/2025: 7868, 07/20/2025: 8125, 07/27/2025: 7612, 08/03/2025: 8210, 08/10/2025: 7783, 08/17/2025: 7612, 08/24/2025: 7868, 08/31/2025: 7270, 09/07/2025: 7612, 09/14/2025: 7441, 09/21/2025: 7184, 09/28/2025: 7868, 10/05/2025: 7270, 10/12/2025: 7868, 10/19/2025: 7868, 10/26/2025: 7441, 11/02/2025: 8039, 11/09/2025: 7355, 11/16/2025: 7441, 11/23/2025: 7270, 11/30/2025: 6500, 12/07/2025: 6842, 12/14/2025: 6329, 12/21/2025: 6414, 12/28/2025: 7013, 01/04/2026: 6927, 01/11/2026: 7783, 01/18/2026: 8039, 01/25/2026: 8039, 02/01/2026: 8552, 02/08/2026: 7868, 02/15/2026: 8381, 02/22/2026: 8296, 03/01/2026: 7954, 03/08/2026: 8724, 03/15/2026: 8296, 03/22/2026: 8552, 03/29/2026: 8724, 04/05/2026: 8039, 04/12/2026: 8552, 04/19/2026: 7954, 04/26/2026: 7783, 05/03/2026: 8210, 05/10/2026: 7441"
