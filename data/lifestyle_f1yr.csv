"phev","A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle that uses batteries to power an electric motor and another fuel, such as gasoline, to power an internal combustion engine. This allows the vehicle to operate on electric power alone for a certain range before switching to the internal combustion engine, providing flexibility and extended range. PHEVs are particularly beneficial for environmentally conscious consumers and those looking to reduce fuel costs while maintaining the convenience of a traditional vehicle.","technology,industry,lifestyle,automotive,eco","No","+4%",110000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Positive","Growing","1 Year (Forecast)","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/phev","Facebook: 1.00, Instagram: 0.97, LinkedIn: 0.90, Pinterest: 0.90, Reddit: 1.00, TikTok: 0.95, Twitter: 0.96, YouTube: 1.00","06/08/2025: 26103, 06/15/2025: 25320, 06/22/2025: 25581, 06/29/2025: 26364, 07/06/2025: 26103, 07/13/2025: 25320, 07/20/2025: 26103, 07/27/2025: 26625, 08/03/2025: 26364, 08/10/2025: 25842, 08/17/2025: 26625, 08/24/2025: 26625, 08/31/2025: 26103, 09/07/2025: 26364, 09/14/2025: 27147, 09/21/2025: 26886, 09/28/2025: 26364, 10/05/2025: 27147, 10/12/2025: 27669, 10/19/2025: 26886, 10/26/2025: 26625, 11/02/2025: 26886, 11/09/2025: 26625, 11/16/2025: 25581, 11/23/2025: 25842, 11/30/2025: 26103, 12/07/2025: 25581, 12/14/2025: 25320, 12/21/2025: 26625, 12/28/2025: 27408, 01/04/2026: 27408, 01/11/2026: 28191, 01/18/2026: 29757, 01/25/2026: 29757, 02/01/2026: 28974, 02/08/2026: 29235, 02/15/2026: 29757, 02/22/2026: 28713, 03/01/2026: 28452, 03/08/2026: 29235, 03/15/2026: 29235, 03/22/2026: 28191, 03/29/2026: 28452, 04/05/2026: 28974, 04/12/2026: 28191, 04/19/2026: 27147, 04/26/2026: 27669, 05/03/2026: 27930, 05/10/2026: 26886, 05/17/2026: 26886"

"Net zero","The concept refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. Achieving this balance means that any emissions are offset by absorbing an equivalent amount through natural processes like reforestation or technological solutions like carbon capture and storage, which is crucial in the fight against climate change. This concept is particularly relevant for countries, companies, and organizations committed to reducing their carbon footprint and limiting global warming.","industry,lifestyle,science,energy,eco","No","+3%",110000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Positive","Growing","1 Year (Forecast)","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/net-zero","Facebook: 0.97, Instagram: 0.95, LinkedIn: 1.00, Pinterest: 0.95, Reddit: 0.90, TikTok: 0.79, Twitter: 1.00, YouTube: 1.00","06/08/2025: 28047, 06/15/2025: 28047, 06/22/2025: 27738, 06/29/2025: 27430, 07/06/2025: 26506, 07/13/2025: 25273, 07/20/2025: 24656, 07/27/2025: 23732, 08/03/2025: 23423, 08/10/2025: 23423, 08/17/2025: 24348, 08/24/2025: 25581, 08/31/2025: 26814, 09/07/2025: 28355, 09/14/2025: 29896, 09/21/2025: 31129, 09/28/2025: 31745, 10/05/2025: 32362, 10/12/2025: 32670, 10/19/2025: 32670, 10/26/2025: 32362, 11/02/2025: 32053, 11/09/2025: 31437, 11/16/2025: 30204, 11/23/2025: 28663, 11/30/2025: 26506, 12/07/2025: 25273, 12/14/2025: 24348, 12/21/2025: 23732, 12/28/2025: 24040, 01/04/2026: 24656, 01/11/2026: 25889, 01/18/2026: 27122, 01/25/2026: 28663, 02/01/2026: 30204, 02/08/2026: 31745, 02/15/2026: 32362, 02/22/2026: 32670, 03/01/2026: 32053, 03/08/2026: 31745, 03/15/2026: 30512, 03/22/2026: 29279, 03/29/2026: 28663, 04/05/2026: 28047, 04/12/2026: 27738, 04/19/2026: 27738, 04/26/2026: 28047, 05/03/2026: 28355, 05/10/2026: 28663"
