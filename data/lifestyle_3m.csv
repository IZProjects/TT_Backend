"Cannibalism in poultry","Cannibalism in poultry is a behavioral issue where birds peck at the feathers, comb, toes, or vent of other birds, often leading to open wounds. This behavior is typically triggered by stress due to poor management practices and can rapidly spread throughout the flock once blood or an open wound is visible. The issue primarily affects poultry farmers and those involved in poultry management, as it can lead to significant health and welfare problems within the flock.","industry,lifestyle,pets,gardening-agriculture,education","No","+5700%",1900,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","High","Negative","Stationary","Past 3 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cannibalism-in-poultry","Facebook: 0.37, Instagram: 0.03, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.07, Reddit: 0.06, TikTok: 0.13, Twitter: 0.14, YouTube: 0.34","03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 678, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 0, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 0, 05/11/2025: 53, 05/18/2025: 342, 05/25/2025: 441, 06/08/2025: 175, 06/15/2025: 114, 06/22/2025: 144, 06/29/2025: 190, 07/06/2025: 137, 07/13/2025: 121, 07/20/2025: 190, 07/27/2025: 167, 08/03/2025: 114, 08/10/2025: 159, 08/17/2025: 182, 08/24/2025: 114, 08/31/2025: 121, 09/07/2025: 167, 09/14/2025: 129, 09/21/2025: 114, 09/28/2025: 175, 10/05/2025: 182, 10/12/2025: 129, 10/19/2025: 167, 10/26/2025: 205, 11/02/2025: 137, 11/09/2025: 129, 11/16/2025: 190, 11/23/2025: 152, 11/30/2025: 106, 12/07/2025: 159, 12/14/2025: 175, 12/21/2025: 114, 12/28/2025: 129, 01/04/2026: 182, 01/11/2026: 137, 01/18/2026: 121, 01/25/2026: 182, 02/01/2026: 175, 02/08/2026: 121, 02/15/2026: 159, 02/22/2026: 190, 03/01/2026: 129, 03/08/2026: 129, 03/15/2026: 182, 03/22/2026: 152, 03/29/2026: 114, 04/05/2026: 175, 04/12/2026: 182, 04/19/2026: 129, 04/26/2026: 159, 05/03/2026: 213, 05/10/2026: 152, 05/17/2026: 137"

"Cramming","The practice involves attempting to absorb a significant amount of information in a limited timeframe, typically before an examination. Cramming is often characterized by intense, last-minute study sessions that aim to cover as much material as possible, which can lead to short-term retention but may not support long-term understanding. This method is commonly used by students who are under time constraints or have procrastinated their study efforts.","lifestyle,education","No","+700%",135000,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Negative","Declining","Past 3 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cramming","Facebook: 0.82, Instagram: 0.89, LinkedIn: 0.64, Pinterest: 0.74, Reddit: 0.85, TikTok: 0.88, Twitter: 0.92, YouTube: 0.82","03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 0, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 43168, 04/27/2025: 31395, 05/04/2025: 31395, 05/11/2025: 11773, 05/18/2025: 27470, 05/25/2025: 31395, 06/08/2025: 86337, 06/15/2025: 86337, 06/22/2025: 113808, 06/29/2025: 94186, 07/06/2025: 86337, 07/13/2025: 105959, 07/20/2025: 78488, 07/27/2025: 70639, 08/03/2025: 82412, 08/10/2025: 62790, 08/17/2025: 62790, 08/24/2025: 78488, 08/31/2025: 66715, 09/07/2025: 62790, 09/14/2025: 78488, 09/21/2025: 58866, 09/28/2025: 51017, 10/05/2025: 54941, 10/12/2025: 39244, 10/19/2025: 31395, 10/26/2025: 39244, 11/02/2025: 31395, 11/09/2025: 27470, 11/16/2025: 35319, 11/23/2025: 27470, 11/30/2025: 27470, 12/07/2025: 31395, 12/14/2025: 23546, 12/21/2025: 19622, 12/28/2025: 19622, 01/04/2026: 11773, 01/11/2026: 11773, 01/18/2026: 11773, 01/25/2026: 7848, 02/01/2026: 7848, 02/08/2026: 7848, 02/15/2026: 3924, 02/22/2026: 3924, 03/01/2026: 3924, 03/08/2026: 3924, 03/15/2026: 3924, 03/22/2026: 3924, 03/29/2026: 3924, 04/05/2026: 3924, 04/12/2026: 7848, 04/19/2026: 7848, 04/26/2026: 11773, 05/03/2026: 15697, 05/10/2026: 11773"

"Monocropping","Monocropping is an agricultural practice where a single crop species is grown in the same field year after year. This method is often used in large-scale farming operations due to its efficiency and the ease of mechanization, but it can lead to increased vulnerability to pests and diseases, depletion of soil nutrients, and reduced biodiversity. Monocropping primarily benefits large-scale farmers and agribusinesses seeking to maximize yield and streamline production processes.","industry,lifestyle,eco,gardening-agriculture","No","+21%",8100,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Negative","Growing","Past 3 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/monocropping","Facebook: 0.38, Instagram: 0.36, LinkedIn: 0.38, Pinterest: 0.18, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.19, Twitter: 0.46, YouTube: 0.41","03/02/2025: 1560, 03/09/2025: 1776, 03/16/2025: 1614, 03/23/2025: 1560, 03/30/2025: 1722, 04/06/2025: 1991, 04/13/2025: 2233, 04/20/2025: 2341, 04/27/2025: 2691, 05/04/2025: 2448, 05/11/2025: 2314, 05/18/2025: 2018, 05/25/2025: 1883, 06/08/2025: 1802, 06/15/2025: 1668, 06/22/2025: 1587, 06/29/2025: 1560, 07/06/2025: 1453, 07/13/2025: 1453, 07/20/2025: 1453, 07/27/2025: 1426, 08/03/2025: 1453, 08/10/2025: 1506, 08/17/2025: 1506, 08/24/2025: 1533, 08/31/2025: 1587, 09/07/2025: 1560, 09/14/2025: 1587, 09/21/2025: 1614, 09/28/2025: 1560, 10/05/2025: 1587, 10/12/2025: 1587, 10/19/2025: 1533, 10/26/2025: 1533, 11/02/2025: 1533, 11/09/2025: 1453, 11/16/2025: 1426, 11/23/2025: 1372, 11/30/2025: 1264, 12/07/2025: 1210, 12/14/2025: 1210, 12/21/2025: 1157, 12/28/2025: 1184, 01/04/2026: 1264, 01/11/2026: 1291, 01/18/2026: 1372, 01/25/2026: 1506, 02/01/2026: 1533, 02/08/2026: 1641, 02/15/2026: 1722, 02/22/2026: 1695, 03/01/2026: 1749, 03/08/2026: 1776, 03/15/2026: 1722, 03/22/2026: 1776, 03/29/2026: 1856, 04/05/2026: 1856, 04/12/2026: 1991, 04/19/2026: 2179, 04/26/2026: 2206, 05/03/2026: 2314, 05/10/2026: 2475"

Elopement weddings are ideal for couples seeking a private, low-stress, and cost-effective alternative to traditional wedding ceremonies.","business,fashion,lifestyle,retail,travel,clothing","No","+11%",22200,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Stationary","Past 3 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/elopement-weddings","Facebook: 0.61, Instagram: 0.58, LinkedIn: 0.18, Pinterest: 0.56, Reddit: 0.18, TikTok: 0.44, Twitter: 0.14, YouTube: 0.34","03/02/2025: 4660, 03/09/2025: 4947, 03/16/2025: 6453, 03/23/2025: 4660, 03/30/2025: 4947, 04/06/2025: 4230, 04/13/2025: 5091, 04/20/2025: 4445, 04/27/2025: 5234, 05/04/2025: 6310, 05/11/2025: 6310, 05/18/2025: 4302, 05/25/2025: 5162, 06/08/2025: 5162, 06/15/2025: 4517, 06/22/2025: 4158, 06/29/2025: 5019, 07/06/2025: 5593, 07/13/2025: 5019, 07/20/2025: 4374, 07/27/2025: 5091, 08/03/2025: 5736, 08/10/2025: 5019, 08/17/2025: 4230, 08/24/2025: 4589, 08/31/2025: 5162, 09/07/2025: 4517, 09/14/2025: 3800, 09/21/2025: 4087, 09/28/2025: 4804, 10/05/2025: 4445, 10/12/2025: 3656, 10/19/2025: 3800, 10/26/2025: 4374, 11/02/2025: 4158, 11/09/2025: 3370, 11/16/2025: 3370, 11/23/2025: 3872, 11/30/2025: 3728, 12/07/2025: 3226, 12/14/2025: 3298, 12/21/2025: 4374, 12/28/2025: 4947, 01/04/2026: 4589, 01/11/2026: 4875, 01/18/2026: 6166, 01/25/2026: 6668, 02/01/2026: 5521, 02/08/2026: 4947, 02/15/2026: 5593, 02/22/2026: 5736, 03/01/2026: 4660, 03/08/2026: 4087, 03/15/2026: 4660, 03/22/2026: 5019, 03/29/2026: 4374, 04/05/2026: 3800, 04/12/2026: 4374, 04/19/2026: 4947, 04/26/2026: 4302, 05/03/2026: 3728, 05/10/2026: 4087"
