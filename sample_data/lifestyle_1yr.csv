"Cannibalism in poultry","Cannibalism in poultry is a behavioral issue where birds peck at the feathers, comb, toes, or vent of other birds, often leading to open wounds. This behavior is typically triggered by stress due to poor management practices and can rapidly spread throughout the flock once blood or an open wound is visible. The issue primarily affects poultry farmers and those involved in poultry management, as it can lead to significant health and welfare problems within the flock.","industry,lifestyle,pets,gardening-agriculture,education","No","+5700%",1900,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","High","Negative","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cannibalism-in-poultry","Facebook: 0.37, Instagram: 0.03, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.07, Reddit: 0.06, TikTok: 0.13, Twitter: 0.14, YouTube: 0.34","06/02/2024: 0, 06/09/2024: 0, 06/16/2024: 0, 06/23/2024: 0, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 0, 07/14/2024: 0, 07/21/2024: 0, 07/28/2024: 0, 08/04/2024: 0, 08/11/2024: 0, 08/18/2024: 0, 08/25/2024: 761, 09/01/2024: 0, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 0, 09/22/2024: 0, 09/29/2024: 0, 10/06/2024: 0, 10/13/2024: 0, 10/20/2024: 0, 10/27/2024: 0, 11/03/2024: 0, 11/10/2024: 0, 11/17/2024: 0, 11/24/2024: 0, 12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 0, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 0, 01/19/2025: 0, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 678, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 0, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 0, 05/11/2025: 53, 05/18/2025: 342, 05/25/2025: 441, 06/08/2025: 175, 06/15/2025: 114, 06/22/2025: 144, 06/29/2025: 190, 07/06/2025: 137, 07/13/2025: 121, 07/20/2025: 190, 07/27/2025: 167, 08/03/2025: 114, 08/10/2025: 159, 08/17/2025: 182, 08/24/2025: 114, 08/31/2025: 121, 09/07/2025: 167, 09/14/2025: 129, 09/21/2025: 114, 09/28/2025: 175, 10/05/2025: 182, 10/12/2025: 129, 10/19/2025: 167, 10/26/2025: 205, 11/02/2025: 137, 11/09/2025: 129, 11/16/2025: 190, 11/23/2025: 152, 11/30/2025: 106, 12/07/2025: 159, 12/14/2025: 175, 12/21/2025: 114, 12/28/2025: 129, 01/04/2026: 182, 01/11/2026: 137, 01/18/2026: 121, 01/25/2026: 182, 02/01/2026: 175, 02/08/2026: 121, 02/15/2026: 159, 02/22/2026: 190, 03/01/2026: 129, 03/08/2026: 129, 03/15/2026: 182, 03/22/2026: 152, 03/29/2026: 114, 04/05/2026: 175, 04/12/2026: 182, 04/19/2026: 129, 04/26/2026: 159, 05/03/2026: 213, 05/10/2026: 152, 05/17/2026: 137"

"Passive hydroponics","Passive hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, where the plants are suspended in a nutrient solution that reaches the roots through gravity, flooding, or capillary action. This system does not require pumps to circulate the solution, making it simpler and more accessible compared to active hydroponic systems. Passive hydroponics is particularly beneficial for hobbyists and small-scale growers who seek a low-maintenance and cost-effective way to cultivate plants indoors or in limited spaces.","industry,lifestyle,eco,gardening-agriculture","No","+5400%",210,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","High","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/passive-hydroponics","Facebook: 0.20, Instagram: 0.06, LinkedIn: 0.05, Pinterest: 0.41, Reddit: 0.40, TikTok: 0.20, Twitter: 0.04, YouTube: 0.38","06/02/2024: 0, 06/09/2024: 0, 06/16/2024: 55, 06/23/2024: 0, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 0, 07/14/2024: 0, 07/21/2024: 0, 07/28/2024: 0, 08/04/2024: 0, 08/11/2024: 0, 08/18/2024: 0, 08/25/2024: 0, 09/01/2024: 0, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 0, 09/22/2024: 0, 09/29/2024: 0, 10/06/2024: 0, 10/13/2024: 0, 10/20/2024: 0, 10/27/2024: 0, 11/03/2024: 0, 11/10/2024: 0, 11/17/2024: 0, 11/24/2024: 0, 12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 0, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 0, 01/19/2025: 0, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 55, 03/09/2025: 54, 03/16/2025: 72, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 58, 04/27/2025: 55, 05/04/2025: 0, 05/11/2025: 88, 05/18/2025: 50, 05/25/2025: 48, 06/08/2025: 69, 06/15/2025: 68, 06/22/2025: 63, 06/29/2025: 60, 07/06/2025: 55, 07/13/2025: 54, 07/20/2025: 51, 07/27/2025: 50, 08/03/2025: 49, 08/10/2025: 50, 08/17/2025: 51, 08/24/2025: 52, 08/31/2025: 55, 09/07/2025: 56, 09/14/2025: 57, 09/21/2025: 58, 09/28/2025: 58, 10/05/2025: 56, 10/12/2025: 54, 10/19/2025: 51, 10/26/2025: 48, 11/02/2025: 46, 11/09/2025: 43, 11/16/2025: 39, 11/23/2025: 37, 11/30/2025: 36, 12/07/2025: 39, 12/14/2025: 43, 12/21/2025: 53, 12/28/2025: 62, 01/04/2026: 72, 01/11/2026: 82, 01/18/2026: 87, 01/25/2026: 89, 02/01/2026: 87, 02/08/2026: 82, 02/15/2026: 77, 02/22/2026: 74, 03/01/2026: 73, 03/08/2026: 75, 03/15/2026: 77, 03/22/2026: 78, 03/29/2026: 75, 04/05/2026: 72, 04/12/2026: 68, 04/19/2026: 61, 04/26/2026: 55, 05/03/2026: 47, 05/10/2026: 41, 05/17/2026: 35"

"Egocentric bias","Cognitive bias where individuals rely heavily on their own perspective and experience, leading to an overestimation of the importance of their own opinions, beliefs, and contributions. This bias can result in a skewed perception of reality, where one's own viewpoint is seen as more central and significant than it actually is, often neglecting or undervaluing the perspectives and contributions of others. Egocentric bias primarily affects individuals in social and professional settings, influencing decision-making, communication, and interpersonal relationships.","business,health,lifestyle,hr,education,mental-health","No","+3300%",2200,"Regular","Accelerating","High","High","Negative","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/egocentric-bias","Facebook: 0.09, Instagram: 0.23, LinkedIn: 0.21, Pinterest: 0.15, Reddit: 0.20, TikTok: 0.23, Twitter: 0.22, YouTube: 0.37","06/02/2024: 0, 06/09/2024: 0, 06/16/2024: 797, 06/23/2024: 0, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 0, 07/14/2024: 0, 07/21/2024: 0, 07/28/2024: 0, 08/04/2024: 0, 08/11/2024: 767, 08/18/2024: 0, 08/25/2024: 1128, 09/01/2024: 0, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 1083, 09/22/2024: 0, 09/29/2024: 827, 10/06/2024: 842, 10/13/2024: 932, 10/20/2024: 0, 10/27/2024: 0, 11/03/2024: 0, 11/10/2024: 782, 11/17/2024: 0, 11/24/2024: 902, 12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 1504, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 0, 01/19/2025: 0, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 993, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 0, 03/16/2025: 1128, 03/23/2025: 1128, 03/30/2025: 1053, 04/06/2025: 1279, 04/13/2025: 963, 04/20/2025: 0, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 0, 05/11/2025: 90, 05/18/2025: 436, 05/25/2025: 511, 06/08/2025: 180, 06/15/2025: 210, 06/22/2025: 300, 06/29/2025: 406, 07/06/2025: 481, 07/13/2025: 481, 07/20/2025: 436, 07/27/2025: 346, 08/03/2025: 240, 08/10/2025: 180, 08/17/2025: 150, 08/24/2025: 165, 08/31/2025: 270, 09/07/2025: 436, 09/14/2025: 632, 09/21/2025: 782, 09/28/2025: 827, 10/05/2025: 767, 10/12/2025: 601, 10/19/2025: 421, 10/26/2025: 270, 11/02/2025: 210, 11/09/2025: 240, 11/16/2025: 331, 11/23/2025: 436, 11/30/2025: 541, 12/07/2025: 601, 12/14/2025: 571, 12/21/2025: 466, 12/28/2025: 331, 01/04/2026: 210, 01/11/2026: 135, 01/18/2026: 150, 01/25/2026: 210, 02/01/2026: 331, 02/08/2026: 481, 02/15/2026: 632, 02/22/2026: 692, 03/01/2026: 662, 03/08/2026: 526, 03/15/2026: 376, 03/22/2026: 255, 03/29/2026: 210, 04/05/2026: 255, 04/12/2026: 376, 04/19/2026: 496, 04/26/2026: 601, 05/03/2026: 616, 05/10/2026: 571"

This type of pet food is primarily targeted at pet owners looking for sustainable and hypoallergenic food options for their pets.","business,food-beverage,lifestyle,pets,eco,cpg","No","+3200%",110,"Exploding","Exponential","High","High","Positive","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/insect-pet-food","Facebook: 0.03, Instagram: 0.00, LinkedIn: 0.15, Pinterest: 0.04, Reddit: 0.00, TikTok: 0.06, Twitter: 0.04, YouTube: 0.07","05/19/2024: 0, 05/26/2024: 0, 06/02/2024: 0, 06/09/2024: 0, 06/16/2024: 0, 06/23/2024: 0, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 0, 07/14/2024: 0, 07/21/2024: 0, 07/28/2024: 0, 08/04/2024: 0, 08/11/2024: 0, 08/18/2024: 0, 08/25/2024: 0, 09/01/2024: 0, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 0, 09/22/2024: 0, 09/29/2024: 0, 10/06/2024: 0, 10/13/2024: 0, 10/20/2024: 0, 10/27/2024: 0, 11/03/2024: 0, 11/10/2024: 0, 11/17/2024: 0, 11/24/2024: 0, 12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 0, 12/15/2024: 0, 12/22/2024: 0, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 0, 01/19/2025: 0, 01/26/2025: 77, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 0, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 0, 03/30/2025: 0, 04/06/2025: 0, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 0, 04/27/2025: 0, 05/04/2025: 9, 05/11/2025: 25, 06/08/2025: 0, 06/15/2025: 6, 06/22/2025: 1, 06/29/2025: 4, 07/06/2025: 6, 07/13/2025: 0, 07/20/2025: 7, 07/27/2025: 1, 08/03/2025: 3, 08/10/2025: 6, 08/17/2025: 0, 08/24/2025: 8, 08/31/2025: 2, 09/07/2025: 4, 09/14/2025: 8, 09/21/2025: 0, 09/28/2025: 9, 10/05/2025: 3, 10/12/2025: 3, 10/19/2025: 6, 10/26/2025: 0, 11/02/2025: 6, 11/09/2025: 2, 11/16/2025: 2, 11/23/2025: 4, 11/30/2025: 0, 12/07/2025: 3, 12/14/2025: 1, 12/21/2025: 1, 12/28/2025: 4, 01/04/2026: 0, 01/11/2026: 6, 01/18/2026: 3, 01/25/2026: 3, 02/01/2026: 9, 02/08/2026: 0, 02/15/2026: 10, 02/22/2026: 5, 03/01/2026: 3, 03/08/2026: 10, 03/15/2026: 0, 03/22/2026: 8, 03/29/2026: 4, 04/05/2026: 2, 04/12/2026: 9, 04/19/2026: 0, 04/26/2026: 7, 05/03/2026: 5, 05/10/2026: 2"

This trend primarily appeals to individuals interested in cosplay, anime enthusiasts, and those seeking a unique and dramatic eye makeup style.","beauty,entertainment,lifestyle,makeup-cosmetics,art,cpg","No","+70%",27100,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Positive","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/manga-lashes-pCXacAZB","Facebook: 0.55, Instagram: 0.72, LinkedIn: 0.05, Pinterest: 0.88, Reddit: 0.45, TikTok: 0.85, Twitter: 0.40, YouTube: 0.51","05/26/2024: 3716, 06/02/2024: 5251, 06/09/2024: 5494, 06/16/2024: 4282, 06/23/2024: 4767, 06/30/2024: 6221, 07/07/2024: 5090, 07/14/2024: 5009, 07/21/2024: 5494, 07/28/2024: 5090, 08/04/2024: 5171, 08/11/2024: 4767, 08/18/2024: 5251, 08/25/2024: 4443, 09/01/2024: 5090, 09/08/2024: 5817, 09/15/2024: 3959, 09/22/2024: 6867, 09/29/2024: 5332, 10/06/2024: 5251, 10/13/2024: 5090, 10/20/2024: 5736, 10/27/2024: 3959, 11/03/2024: 4686, 11/10/2024: 6787, 11/17/2024: 4443, 11/24/2024: 5171, 12/01/2024: 5090, 12/08/2024: 7271, 12/15/2024: 7433, 12/22/2024: 7029, 12/29/2024: 5817, 01/05/2025: 5413, 01/12/2025: 6140, 01/19/2025: 6383, 01/26/2025: 6302, 02/02/2025: 5979, 02/09/2025: 5817, 02/16/2025: 6867, 02/23/2025: 5979, 03/02/2025: 8079, 03/09/2025: 5898, 03/16/2025: 7271, 03/23/2025: 7029, 03/30/2025: 6948, 04/06/2025: 7433, 04/13/2025: 7191, 04/20/2025: 6948, 04/27/2025: 6302, 05/04/2025: 7595, 05/11/2025: 6625, 05/18/2025: 6302, 06/08/2025: 6867, 06/15/2025: 7433, 06/22/2025: 6948, 06/29/2025: 6948, 07/06/2025: 7595, 07/13/2025: 7110, 07/20/2025: 7029, 07/27/2025: 7595, 08/03/2025: 7110, 08/10/2025: 6948, 08/17/2025: 7433, 08/24/2025: 6867, 08/31/2025: 6706, 09/07/2025: 7110, 09/14/2025: 6706, 09/21/2025: 6544, 09/28/2025: 7029, 10/05/2025: 6625, 10/12/2025: 6544, 10/19/2025: 7029, 10/26/2025: 6544, 11/02/2025: 6463, 11/09/2025: 6948, 11/16/2025: 6625, 11/23/2025: 6706, 11/30/2025: 7352, 12/07/2025: 7110, 12/14/2025: 7110, 12/21/2025: 7675, 12/28/2025: 7271, 01/04/2026: 7110, 01/11/2026: 7514, 01/18/2026: 6948, 01/25/2026: 6867, 02/01/2026: 7433, 02/08/2026: 6948, 02/15/2026: 6867, 02/22/2026: 7514, 03/01/2026: 7110, 03/08/2026: 7029, 03/15/2026: 7595, 03/22/2026: 7110, 03/29/2026: 7029, 04/05/2026: 7595, 04/12/2026: 7029, 04/19/2026: 6867, 04/26/2026: 7352, 05/03/2026: 6867, 05/10/2026: 6787, 05/17/2026: 7191"

Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's 40s but can start as early as the mid-30s, affecting women who are approaching menopause.","health,industry,lifestyle,fitness,healthcare,pharma","No","+62%",550000,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Neutral","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/perimenopause","Facebook: 0.94, Instagram: 1.00, LinkedIn: 0.96, Pinterest: 0.98, Reddit: 1.00, TikTok: 1.00, Twitter: 0.82, YouTube: 0.95","06/02/2024: 79117, 06/09/2024: 79117, 06/16/2024: 77799, 06/23/2024: 79117, 06/30/2024: 73843, 07/07/2024: 83073, 07/14/2024: 84392, 07/21/2024: 84392, 07/28/2024: 84392, 08/04/2024: 83073, 08/11/2024: 94941, 08/18/2024: 90985, 08/25/2024: 89666, 09/01/2024: 89666, 09/08/2024: 89666, 09/15/2024: 97578, 09/22/2024: 100215, 09/29/2024: 92304, 10/06/2024: 88348, 10/13/2024: 93622, 10/20/2024: 109446, 10/27/2024: 106808, 11/03/2024: 92304, 11/10/2024: 92304, 11/17/2024: 90985, 11/24/2024: 81754, 12/01/2024: 85710, 12/08/2024: 90985, 12/15/2024: 85710, 12/22/2024: 85710, 12/29/2024: 97578, 01/05/2025: 104171, 01/12/2025: 102853, 01/19/2025: 94941, 01/26/2025: 101534, 02/02/2025: 101534, 02/09/2025: 100215, 02/16/2025: 104171, 02/23/2025: 112083, 03/02/2025: 110764, 03/09/2025: 114720, 03/16/2025: 114720, 03/23/2025: 117357, 03/30/2025: 131862, 04/06/2025: 117357, 04/13/2025: 116039, 04/20/2025: 123951, 04/27/2025: 122632, 05/04/2025: 117357, 05/11/2025: 119995, 05/18/2025: 117357, 05/25/2025: 127906, 06/08/2025: 123951, 06/15/2025: 125269, 06/22/2025: 125269, 06/29/2025: 131862, 07/06/2025: 130544, 07/13/2025: 131862, 07/20/2025: 135818, 07/27/2025: 133181, 08/03/2025: 134500, 08/10/2025: 135818, 08/17/2025: 131862, 08/24/2025: 135818, 08/31/2025: 134500, 09/07/2025: 134500, 09/14/2025: 138456, 09/21/2025: 137137, 09/28/2025: 139774, 10/05/2025: 142411, 10/12/2025: 139774, 10/19/2025: 143730, 10/26/2025: 141093, 11/02/2025: 135818, 11/09/2025: 137137, 11/16/2025: 133181, 11/23/2025: 131862, 11/30/2025: 133181, 12/07/2025: 129225, 12/14/2025: 131862, 12/21/2025: 134500, 12/28/2025: 134500, 01/04/2026: 141093, 01/11/2026: 142411, 01/18/2026: 145049, 01/25/2026: 151642, 02/01/2026: 149005, 02/08/2026: 151642, 02/15/2026: 152960, 02/22/2026: 150323, 03/01/2026: 155598, 03/08/2026: 155598, 03/15/2026: 155598, 03/22/2026: 162191, 03/29/2026: 160872, 04/05/2026: 163509, 04/12/2026: 168784, 04/19/2026: 166147, 04/26/2026: 170103, 05/03/2026: 170103, 05/10/2026: 163509, 05/17/2026: 166147"

"Monocropping","Monocropping is an agricultural practice where a single crop species is grown in the same field year after year. This method is often used in large-scale farming operations due to its efficiency and the ease of mechanization, but it can lead to increased vulnerability to pests and diseases, depletion of soil nutrients, and reduced biodiversity. Monocropping primarily benefits large-scale farmers and agribusinesses seeking to maximize yield and streamline production processes.","industry,lifestyle,eco,gardening-agriculture","No","+30%",8100,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Low","Negative","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/monocropping","Facebook: 0.38, Instagram: 0.36, LinkedIn: 0.38, Pinterest: 0.18, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.19, Twitter: 0.46, YouTube: 0.41","06/02/2024: 1453, 06/09/2024: 1533, 06/16/2024: 1426, 06/23/2024: 1291, 06/30/2024: 1130, 07/07/2024: 1022, 07/14/2024: 968, 07/21/2024: 995, 07/28/2024: 968, 08/04/2024: 888, 08/11/2024: 914, 08/18/2024: 1237, 08/25/2024: 1076, 09/01/2024: 1399, 09/08/2024: 1210, 09/15/2024: 1103, 09/22/2024: 1210, 09/29/2024: 1372, 10/06/2024: 1264, 10/13/2024: 1345, 10/20/2024: 1480, 10/27/2024: 1237, 11/03/2024: 1399, 11/10/2024: 1237, 11/17/2024: 1237, 11/24/2024: 995, 12/01/2024: 1291, 12/08/2024: 1318, 12/15/2024: 1022, 12/22/2024: 645, 12/29/2024: 753, 01/05/2025: 1076, 01/12/2025: 1264, 01/19/2025: 1399, 01/26/2025: 1614, 02/02/2025: 1668, 02/09/2025: 1641, 02/16/2025: 1426, 02/23/2025: 1776, 03/02/2025: 1560, 03/09/2025: 1776, 03/16/2025: 1614, 03/23/2025: 1560, 03/30/2025: 1722, 04/06/2025: 1991, 04/13/2025: 2233, 04/20/2025: 2341, 04/27/2025: 2691, 05/04/2025: 2448, 05/11/2025: 2314, 05/18/2025: 2018, 05/25/2025: 1883, 06/08/2025: 1802, 06/15/2025: 1668, 06/22/2025: 1587, 06/29/2025: 1560, 07/06/2025: 1453, 07/13/2025: 1453, 07/20/2025: 1453, 07/27/2025: 1426, 08/03/2025: 1453, 08/10/2025: 1506, 08/17/2025: 1506, 08/24/2025: 1533, 08/31/2025: 1587, 09/07/2025: 1560, 09/14/2025: 1587, 09/21/2025: 1614, 09/28/2025: 1560, 10/05/2025: 1587, 10/12/2025: 1587, 10/19/2025: 1533, 10/26/2025: 1533, 11/02/2025: 1533, 11/09/2025: 1453, 11/16/2025: 1426, 11/23/2025: 1372, 11/30/2025: 1264, 12/07/2025: 1210, 12/14/2025: 1210, 12/21/2025: 1157, 12/28/2025: 1184, 01/04/2026: 1264, 01/11/2026: 1291, 01/18/2026: 1372, 01/25/2026: 1506, 02/01/2026: 1533, 02/08/2026: 1641, 02/15/2026: 1722, 02/22/2026: 1695, 03/01/2026: 1749, 03/08/2026: 1776, 03/15/2026: 1722, 03/22/2026: 1776, 03/29/2026: 1856, 04/05/2026: 1856, 04/12/2026: 1991, 04/19/2026: 2179, 04/26/2026: 2206, 05/03/2026: 2314, 05/10/2026: 2475"

"Box breathing","Box breathing is a relaxation technique that involves a structured pattern of inhaling, holding the breath, exhaling, and holding the breath again, each for a count of four. This method is used to reduce stress, enhance focus, and promote a sense of calm by regulating the breath and activating the body's parasympathetic nervous system. Box breathing is particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, or those seeking to improve their concentration and mental clarity.","health,lifestyle,fitness,mental-health,healthcare","No","+29%",60500,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/box-breathing","Facebook: 0.70, Instagram: 0.81, LinkedIn: 0.63, Pinterest: 0.78, Reddit: 0.66, TikTok: 0.71, Twitter: 0.63, YouTube: 0.82","06/02/2024: 10924, 06/09/2024: 12248, 06/16/2024: 12580, 06/23/2024: 11752, 06/30/2024: 9931, 07/07/2024: 11255, 07/14/2024: 10759, 07/21/2024: 11586, 07/28/2024: 11255, 08/04/2024: 11255, 08/11/2024: 11752, 08/18/2024: 12083, 08/25/2024: 10924, 09/01/2024: 10593, 09/08/2024: 12414, 09/15/2024: 13076, 09/22/2024: 12083, 09/29/2024: 11752, 10/06/2024: 12083, 10/13/2024: 10097, 10/20/2024: 13738, 10/27/2024: 11421, 11/03/2024: 12745, 11/10/2024: 12580, 11/17/2024: 12414, 11/24/2024: 11090, 12/01/2024: 12911, 12/08/2024: 12911, 12/15/2024: 12083, 12/22/2024: 8276, 12/29/2024: 11917, 01/05/2025: 13573, 01/12/2025: 12414, 01/19/2025: 13076, 01/26/2025: 13738, 02/02/2025: 16552, 02/09/2025: 16221, 02/16/2025: 15228, 02/23/2025: 13738, 03/02/2025: 15725, 03/09/2025: 14897, 03/16/2025: 15393, 03/23/2025: 12911, 03/30/2025: 13242, 04/06/2025: 14566, 04/13/2025: 13573, 04/20/2025: 13738, 04/27/2025: 14235, 05/04/2025: 15228, 05/11/2025: 14897, 05/18/2025: 15393, 05/25/2025: 14069, 06/08/2025: 14235, 06/15/2025: 14069, 06/22/2025: 14069, 06/29/2025: 14069, 07/06/2025: 14235, 07/13/2025: 14400, 07/20/2025: 14566, 07/27/2025: 14566, 08/03/2025: 14731, 08/10/2025: 14897, 08/17/2025: 15062, 08/24/2025: 15228, 08/31/2025: 15062, 09/07/2025: 15062, 09/14/2025: 15062, 09/21/2025: 14897, 09/28/2025: 14897, 10/05/2025: 14731, 10/12/2025: 14731, 10/19/2025: 14566, 10/26/2025: 14566, 11/02/2025: 14566, 11/09/2025: 14400, 11/16/2025: 14235, 11/23/2025: 13904, 11/30/2025: 13407, 12/07/2025: 13242, 12/14/2025: 13076, 12/21/2025: 12911, 12/28/2025: 13076, 01/04/2026: 13242, 01/11/2026: 13573, 01/18/2026: 13738, 01/25/2026: 13904, 02/01/2026: 14069, 02/08/2026: 14069, 02/15/2026: 13904, 02/22/2026: 13738, 03/01/2026: 13573, 03/08/2026: 13407, 03/15/2026: 13076, 03/22/2026: 13076, 03/29/2026: 12911, 04/05/2026: 12911, 04/12/2026: 12911, 04/19/2026: 13076, 04/26/2026: 13076, 05/03/2026: 12911, 05/10/2026: 12911, 05/17/2026: 12745"

Ghostwriting is commonly used in fields such as politics, entertainment, business, and academia, and it typically involves confidentiality agreements to keep the ghostwriter's involvement undisclosed.","business,entertainment,industry,lifestyle,education,media,marketing","No","+29%",110000,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Low","Neutral","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/ghostwriting","Facebook: 0.81, Instagram: 0.82, LinkedIn: 0.99, Pinterest: 0.70, Reddit: 0.79, TikTok: 0.76, Twitter: 0.90, YouTube: 0.77","06/02/2024: 19825, 06/09/2024: 17267, 06/16/2024: 22063, 06/23/2024: 22063, 06/30/2024: 17267, 07/07/2024: 20465, 07/14/2024: 21744, 07/21/2024: 22703, 07/28/2024: 19505, 08/04/2024: 16947, 08/11/2024: 19505, 08/18/2024: 26540, 08/25/2024: 22703, 09/01/2024: 22383, 09/08/2024: 20145, 09/15/2024: 21744, 09/22/2024: 19505, 09/29/2024: 19186, 10/06/2024: 17906, 10/13/2024: 23023, 10/20/2024: 19186, 10/27/2024: 20465, 11/03/2024: 20145, 11/10/2024: 23023, 11/17/2024: 21424, 11/24/2024: 18546, 12/01/2024: 17906, 12/08/2024: 20145, 12/15/2024: 18546, 12/22/2024: 18226, 12/29/2024: 24622, 01/05/2025: 24302, 01/12/2025: 24622, 01/19/2025: 23982, 01/26/2025: 30697, 02/02/2025: 31976, 02/09/2025: 23982, 02/16/2025: 23343, 02/23/2025: 22383, 03/02/2025: 23662, 03/09/2025: 23662, 03/16/2025: 23982, 03/23/2025: 25261, 03/30/2025: 23023, 04/06/2025: 28779, 04/13/2025: 19825, 04/20/2025: 24302, 04/27/2025: 25901, 05/04/2025: 28139, 05/11/2025: 25901, 05/18/2025: 24622, 05/25/2025: 25581, 06/08/2025: 24941, 06/15/2025: 24302, 06/22/2025: 24941, 06/29/2025: 26540, 07/06/2025: 25581, 07/13/2025: 25901, 07/20/2025: 26860, 07/27/2025: 25261, 08/03/2025: 25581, 08/10/2025: 25901, 08/17/2025: 24622, 08/24/2025: 24622, 08/31/2025: 25261, 09/07/2025: 23662, 09/14/2025: 23982, 09/21/2025: 24622, 09/28/2025: 23343, 10/05/2025: 23982, 10/12/2025: 24622, 10/19/2025: 23343, 10/26/2025: 23982, 11/02/2025: 24622, 11/09/2025: 23023, 11/16/2025: 23343, 11/23/2025: 23023, 11/30/2025: 21424, 12/07/2025: 21424, 12/14/2025: 21424, 12/21/2025: 21104, 12/28/2025: 23023, 01/04/2026: 24302, 01/11/2026: 24622, 01/18/2026: 26860, 01/25/2026: 28139, 02/01/2026: 27180, 02/08/2026: 28459, 02/15/2026: 28459, 02/22/2026: 26540, 03/01/2026: 27180, 03/08/2026: 26540, 03/15/2026: 24622, 03/22/2026: 25261, 03/29/2026: 25261, 04/05/2026: 23982, 04/12/2026: 25261, 04/19/2026: 25261, 04/26/2026: 24622, 05/03/2026: 25901, 05/10/2026: 25581, 05/17/2026: 24622"

"Sunk cost fallacy","The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias where individuals continue an endeavor due to previously invested resources, despite new evidence suggesting that the costs outweigh the benefits. This fallacy leads people to make irrational decisions based on past investments rather than current and future outcomes.

Slow feeder bowls are particularly beneficial for pet owners looking to improve their pets' eating habits, digestion, and overall health.","home,lifestyle,ecommerce,pets","No","+16%",5400,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/slow-feeder-bowl","Facebook: 0.57, Instagram: 0.59, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.74, Reddit: 0.46, TikTok: 0.70, Twitter: 0.33, YouTube: 0.53","06/02/2024: 1083, 06/09/2024: 1130, 06/16/2024: 1365, 06/23/2024: 1051, 06/30/2024: 1255, 07/07/2024: 1193, 07/14/2024: 1428, 07/21/2024: 1177, 07/28/2024: 1177, 08/04/2024: 1240, 08/11/2024: 1177, 08/18/2024: 1145, 08/25/2024: 1193, 09/01/2024: 1208, 09/08/2024: 1193, 09/15/2024: 1397, 09/22/2024: 1177, 09/29/2024: 1240, 10/06/2024: 1193, 10/13/2024: 1193, 10/20/2024: 1051, 10/27/2024: 1114, 11/03/2024: 1177, 11/10/2024: 1271, 11/17/2024: 1114, 11/24/2024: 1193, 12/01/2024: 1224, 12/08/2024: 1287, 12/15/2024: 1271, 12/22/2024: 1381, 12/29/2024: 1569, 01/05/2025: 1334, 01/12/2025: 1428, 01/19/2025: 1522, 01/26/2025: 1522, 02/02/2025: 1428, 02/09/2025: 1271, 02/16/2025: 1287, 02/23/2025: 1287, 03/02/2025: 1287, 03/09/2025: 1381, 03/16/2025: 1397, 03/23/2025: 1506, 03/30/2025: 1271, 04/06/2025: 1145, 04/13/2025: 1067, 04/20/2025: 1318, 04/27/2025: 1334, 05/04/2025: 1302, 05/11/2025: 1177, 05/18/2025: 1240, 05/25/2025: 1255, 06/08/2025: 1287, 06/15/2025: 1287, 06/22/2025: 1287, 06/29/2025: 1271, 07/06/2025: 1255, 07/13/2025: 1224, 07/20/2025: 1208, 07/27/2025: 1193, 08/03/2025: 1193, 08/10/2025: 1193, 08/17/2025: 1224, 08/24/2025: 1240, 08/31/2025: 1271, 09/07/2025: 1287, 09/14/2025: 1271, 09/21/2025: 1255, 09/28/2025: 1224, 10/05/2025: 1177, 10/12/2025: 1161, 10/19/2025: 1161, 10/26/2025: 1161, 11/02/2025: 1193, 11/09/2025: 1224, 11/16/2025: 1271, 11/23/2025: 1302, 11/30/2025: 1334, 12/07/2025: 1365, 12/14/2025: 1412, 12/21/2025: 1428, 12/28/2025: 1475, 01/04/2026: 1522, 01/11/2026: 1554, 01/18/2026: 1569, 01/25/2026: 1569, 02/01/2026: 1554, 02/08/2026: 1538, 02/15/2026: 1538, 02/22/2026: 1554, 03/01/2026: 1585, 03/08/2026: 1616, 03/15/2026: 1648, 03/22/2026: 1632, 03/29/2026: 1585, 04/05/2026: 1522, 04/12/2026: 1428, 04/19/2026: 1350, 04/26/2026: 1287, 05/03/2026: 1271, 05/10/2026: 1287"

"Estrogen spray","A form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used to treat symptoms associated with menopause, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and osteoporosis. It is applied topically to the skin, allowing estrogen to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream, offering a more consistent delivery of hormones and potentially fewer side effects compared to other forms of HRT. This method is particularly beneficial for individuals who prefer not to take oral estrogen or use patches.","health,lifestyle,pharma,healthcare,personal-care","No","+14%",1000,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","High","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/estrogen-spray-hQN6R6h5","Facebook: 0.01, Instagram: 0.00, LinkedIn: 0.05, Pinterest: 0.00, Reddit: 0.20, TikTok: 0.19, Twitter: 0.04, YouTube: 0.04","06/02/2024: 204, 06/09/2024: 188, 06/16/2024: 0, 06/23/2024: 240, 06/30/2024: 0, 07/07/2024: 200, 07/14/2024: 204, 07/21/2024: 288, 07/28/2024: 264, 08/04/2024: 0, 08/11/2024: 184, 08/18/2024: 312, 08/25/2024: 288, 09/01/2024: 244, 09/08/2024: 0, 09/15/2024: 204, 09/22/2024: 0, 09/29/2024: 0, 10/06/2024: 0, 10/13/2024: 216, 10/20/2024: 0, 10/27/2024: 308, 11/03/2024: 356, 11/10/2024: 276, 11/17/2024: 0, 11/24/2024: 0, 12/01/2024: 0, 12/08/2024: 252, 12/15/2024: 236, 12/22/2024: 216, 12/29/2024: 0, 01/05/2025: 0, 01/12/2025: 204, 01/19/2025: 304, 01/26/2025: 0, 02/02/2025: 0, 02/09/2025: 0, 02/16/2025: 0, 02/23/2025: 300, 03/02/2025: 352, 03/09/2025: 260, 03/16/2025: 308, 03/23/2025: 296, 03/30/2025: 292, 04/06/2025: 276, 04/13/2025: 400, 04/20/2025: 348, 04/27/2025: 204, 05/04/2025: 220, 05/11/2025: 308, 05/18/2025: 220, 05/25/2025: 232, 06/08/2025: 276, 06/15/2025: 252, 06/22/2025: 216, 06/29/2025: 188, 07/06/2025: 176, 07/13/2025: 188, 07/20/2025: 220, 07/27/2025: 260, 08/03/2025: 296, 08/10/2025: 308, 08/17/2025: 296, 08/24/2025: 264, 08/31/2025: 220, 09/07/2025: 192, 09/14/2025: 180, 09/21/2025: 196, 09/28/2025: 228, 10/05/2025: 264, 10/12/2025: 292, 10/19/2025: 296, 10/26/2025: 284, 11/02/2025: 252, 11/09/2025: 216, 11/16/2025: 192, 11/23/2025: 192, 11/30/2025: 212, 12/07/2025: 248, 12/14/2025: 288, 12/21/2025: 312, 12/28/2025: 312, 01/04/2026: 292, 01/11/2026: 256, 01/18/2026: 220, 01/25/2026: 196, 02/01/2026: 196, 02/08/2026: 212, 02/15/2026: 248, 02/22/2026: 284, 03/01/2026: 308, 03/08/2026: 312, 03/15/2026: 300, 03/22/2026: 268, 03/29/2026: 244, 04/05/2026: 236, 04/12/2026: 248, 04/19/2026: 284, 04/26/2026: 332, 05/03/2026: 368, 05/10/2026: 376"

The circular economy primarily benefits businesses, policymakers, and environmental advocates aiming to promote sustainable development and resource efficiency.","business,industry,lifestyle,manufacturing,energy,eco","No","+13%",74000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Stationary","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/circular-economy-1","Facebook: 0.93, Instagram: 0.92, LinkedIn: 1.00, Pinterest: 0.86, Reddit: 0.70, TikTok: 0.64, Twitter: 0.98, YouTube: 0.96","06/02/2024: 15275, 06/09/2024: 15469, 06/16/2024: 13342, 06/23/2024: 12568, 06/30/2024: 12568, 07/07/2024: 13342, 07/14/2024: 12568, 07/21/2024: 12761, 07/28/2024: 12375, 08/04/2024: 11795, 08/11/2024: 12375, 08/18/2024: 13342, 08/25/2024: 14888, 09/01/2024: 15275, 09/08/2024: 16435, 09/15/2024: 17789, 09/22/2024: 17015, 09/29/2024: 17209, 10/06/2024: 17209, 10/13/2024: 16822, 10/20/2024: 17982, 10/27/2024: 15275, 11/03/2024: 16629, 11/10/2024: 16629, 11/17/2024: 17209, 11/24/2024: 17402, 12/01/2024: 16629, 12/08/2024: 17015, 12/15/2024: 14502, 12/22/2024: 7541, 12/29/2024: 8507, 01/05/2025: 13922, 01/12/2025: 17015, 01/19/2025: 16629, 01/26/2025: 17015, 02/02/2025: 18176, 02/09/2025: 19336, 02/16/2025: 18756, 02/23/2025: 18949, 03/02/2025: 18756, 03/09/2025: 18369, 03/16/2025: 18756, 03/23/2025: 17982, 03/30/2025: 17596, 04/06/2025: 16049, 04/13/2025: 14695, 04/20/2025: 15855, 04/27/2025: 17015, 05/04/2025: 16629, 05/11/2025: 17596, 05/18/2025: 16435, 05/25/2025: 17209, 06/08/2025: 15662, 06/15/2025: 15275, 06/22/2025: 14888, 06/29/2025: 14502, 07/06/2025: 14115, 07/13/2025: 13922, 07/20/2025: 13728, 07/27/2025: 13728, 08/03/2025: 13922, 08/10/2025: 14695, 08/17/2025: 15469, 08/24/2025: 16629, 08/31/2025: 17596, 09/07/2025: 18369, 09/14/2025: 18756, 09/21/2025: 18949, 09/28/2025: 18756, 10/05/2025: 18369, 10/12/2025: 18369, 10/19/2025: 18176, 10/26/2025: 18369, 11/02/2025: 18176, 11/09/2025: 18176, 11/16/2025: 17596, 11/23/2025: 16435, 11/30/2025: 15275, 12/07/2025: 13922, 12/14/2025: 12955, 12/21/2025: 12761, 12/28/2025: 12761, 01/04/2026: 13342, 01/11/2026: 13922, 01/18/2026: 14888, 01/25/2026: 15469, 02/01/2026: 16242, 02/08/2026: 16629, 02/15/2026: 17015, 02/22/2026: 17402, 03/01/2026: 17402, 03/08/2026: 17209, 03/15/2026: 17015, 03/22/2026: 16629, 03/29/2026: 16049, 04/05/2026: 15662, 04/12/2026: 15082, 04/19/2026: 14695, 04/26/2026: 14308, 05/03/2026: 14115, 05/10/2026: 14115"

"attachment theory","Psychological framework that describes the dynamics of long-term interpersonal relationships between humans. Initially developed by John Bowlby and later expanded by Mary Ainsworth, it identifies different attachment styles such as secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant, which influence how individuals form and maintain relationships. This theory is particularly relevant for psychologists, social workers, and educators aiming to understand and improve emotional well-being and relationship dynamics.","health,lifestyle,science,mental-health,education,dating-relationships","No","+12%",60500,"Exploding","Exponential","High","Average","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/attachment-theory","Facebook: 0.68, Instagram: 0.76, LinkedIn: 0.62, Pinterest: 0.81, Reddit: 0.73, TikTok: 0.65, Twitter: 0.71, YouTube: 0.73","05/26/2024: 12577, 06/02/2024: 13430, 06/09/2024: 12151, 06/16/2024: 11724, 06/23/2024: 11724, 06/30/2024: 9806, 07/07/2024: 10658, 07/14/2024: 10445, 07/21/2024: 10658, 07/28/2024: 9806, 08/04/2024: 10019, 08/11/2024: 9379, 08/18/2024: 10658, 08/25/2024: 11085, 09/01/2024: 11937, 09/08/2024: 14496, 09/15/2024: 15135, 09/22/2024: 15988, 09/29/2024: 17480, 10/06/2024: 18972, 10/13/2024: 18333, 10/20/2024: 19399, 10/27/2024: 16627, 11/03/2024: 19186, 11/10/2024: 19399, 11/17/2024: 18546, 11/24/2024: 15135, 12/01/2024: 19186, 12/08/2024: 19612, 12/15/2024: 13003, 12/22/2024: 7461, 12/29/2024: 9166, 01/05/2025: 12577, 01/12/2025: 14709, 01/19/2025: 14709, 01/26/2025: 17480, 02/02/2025: 20678, 02/09/2025: 21317, 02/16/2025: 18546, 02/23/2025: 19612, 03/02/2025: 20678, 03/09/2025: 20038, 03/16/2025: 20038, 03/23/2025: 19612, 03/30/2025: 20465, 04/06/2025: 19186, 04/13/2025: 16201, 04/20/2025: 16414, 04/27/2025: 17693, 05/04/2025: 17054, 05/11/2025: 16841, 05/18/2025: 14069, 06/08/2025: 13856, 06/15/2025: 12790, 06/22/2025: 12577, 06/29/2025: 12577, 07/06/2025: 11724, 07/13/2025: 11298, 07/20/2025: 11511, 07/27/2025: 10872, 08/03/2025: 10872, 08/10/2025: 11724, 08/17/2025: 11724, 08/24/2025: 13003, 08/31/2025: 14282, 09/07/2025: 14496, 09/14/2025: 15988, 09/21/2025: 16841, 09/28/2025: 16414, 10/05/2025: 17480, 10/12/2025: 18333, 10/19/2025: 17693, 10/26/2025: 18759, 11/02/2025: 19186, 11/09/2025: 18333, 11/16/2025: 18759, 11/23/2025: 18120, 11/30/2025: 16627, 12/07/2025: 16627, 12/14/2025: 15562, 12/21/2025: 14496, 12/28/2025: 14922, 01/04/2026: 14922, 01/11/2026: 14496, 01/18/2026: 15775, 01/25/2026: 16414, 02/01/2026: 16414, 02/08/2026: 17906, 02/15/2026: 18546, 02/22/2026: 18333, 03/01/2026: 19612, 03/08/2026: 19186, 03/15/2026: 18333, 03/22/2026: 19399, 03/29/2026: 18546, 04/05/2026: 17906, 04/12/2026: 18759, 04/19/2026: 18333, 04/26/2026: 17906, 05/03/2026: 18759, 05/10/2026: 18333"

This issue primarily impacts industries reliant on natural resources, environmental conservation efforts, and communities dependent on these resources for their livelihoods.","industry,lifestyle,science,energy,eco,manufacturing","No","+11%",6600,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Average","Negative","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/resource-depletion","Facebook: 0.38, Instagram: 0.35, LinkedIn: 0.40, Pinterest: 0.42, Reddit: 0.51, TikTok: 0.20, Twitter: 0.43, YouTube: 0.45","06/02/2024: 1377, 06/09/2024: 1238, 06/16/2024: 1063, 06/23/2024: 1133, 06/30/2024: 854, 07/07/2024: 976, 07/14/2024: 715, 07/21/2024: 802, 07/28/2024: 558, 08/04/2024: 784, 08/11/2024: 715, 08/18/2024: 1046, 08/25/2024: 1168, 09/01/2024: 1029, 09/08/2024: 1220, 09/15/2024: 1308, 09/22/2024: 1116, 09/29/2024: 1220, 10/06/2024: 1203, 10/13/2024: 1238, 10/20/2024: 1482, 10/27/2024: 1168, 11/03/2024: 1168, 11/10/2024: 1308, 11/17/2024: 1465, 11/24/2024: 1151, 12/01/2024: 1377, 12/08/2024: 1430, 12/15/2024: 872, 12/22/2024: 505, 12/29/2024: 453, 01/05/2025: 819, 01/12/2025: 732, 01/19/2025: 976, 01/26/2025: 1238, 02/02/2025: 1133, 02/09/2025: 1238, 02/16/2025: 1203, 02/23/2025: 1151, 03/02/2025: 1186, 03/09/2025: 1273, 03/16/2025: 1325, 03/23/2025: 1308, 03/30/2025: 1534, 04/06/2025: 1552, 04/13/2025: 1343, 04/20/2025: 1377, 04/27/2025: 1744, 05/04/2025: 1569, 05/11/2025: 1500, 05/18/2025: 1343, 05/25/2025: 1534, 06/08/2025: 1412, 06/15/2025: 1325, 06/22/2025: 1308, 06/29/2025: 1325, 07/06/2025: 1325, 07/13/2025: 1308, 07/20/2025: 1412, 07/27/2025: 1482, 08/03/2025: 1447, 08/10/2025: 1569, 08/17/2025: 1639, 08/24/2025: 1674, 08/31/2025: 1796, 09/07/2025: 1953, 09/14/2025: 1988, 09/21/2025: 2110, 09/28/2025: 2180, 10/05/2025: 2145, 10/12/2025: 2197, 10/19/2025: 2110, 10/26/2025: 1988, 11/02/2025: 1953, 11/09/2025: 1796, 11/16/2025: 1604, 11/23/2025: 1412, 11/30/2025: 1255, 12/07/2025: 1063, 12/14/2025: 941, 12/21/2025: 784, 12/28/2025: 767, 01/04/2026: 784, 01/11/2026: 784, 01/18/2026: 837, 01/25/2026: 941, 02/01/2026: 1098, 02/08/2026: 1151, 02/15/2026: 1412, 02/22/2026: 1552, 03/01/2026: 1761, 03/08/2026: 1953, 03/15/2026: 2110, 03/22/2026: 2145, 03/29/2026: 2267, 04/05/2026: 2267, 04/12/2026: 2145, 04/19/2026: 2110, 04/26/2026: 1953, 05/03/2026: 1831, 05/10/2026: 1883"

"Torii","A traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at the entrance of or within a Shinto shrine, symbolizing the transition from the mundane to the sacred. The Torii serves as a marker where kami (spirits or gods) are welcomed and thought to travel through, often featuring a simple yet elegant design that includes two vertical pillars and a horizontal crossbar.

"Vertical Farming","Agricultural process where crops are grown in stacked layers, often integrated into structures like skyscrapers or repurposed warehouses. This method conserves space and results in higher crop yields per square foot, utilizing controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technologies such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics to optimize plant growth. Vertical farming is particularly beneficial for urban areas, reducing the distance food travels from farm to table and minimizing the need for water and pesticides.","business,technology,industry,lifestyle,real-estate,ai,eco","No","+6%",74000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/vertical-farming","Facebook: 0.81, Instagram: 0.74, LinkedIn: 0.87, Pinterest: 0.93, Reddit: 0.75, TikTok: 0.68, Twitter: 0.78, YouTube: 0.83","05/26/2024: 16220, 06/02/2024: 16220, 06/09/2024: 17209, 06/16/2024: 15033, 06/23/2024: 15231, 06/30/2024: 14044, 07/07/2024: 12461, 07/14/2024: 12659, 07/21/2024: 13055, 07/28/2024: 10879, 08/04/2024: 11077, 08/11/2024: 14044, 08/18/2024: 14637, 08/25/2024: 14439, 09/01/2024: 15429, 09/08/2024: 16220, 09/15/2024: 15429, 09/22/2024: 16220, 09/29/2024: 15824, 10/06/2024: 17209, 10/13/2024: 17011, 10/20/2024: 17802, 10/27/2024: 16813, 11/03/2024: 16813, 11/10/2024: 18989, 11/17/2024: 19385, 11/24/2024: 17209, 12/01/2024: 17407, 12/08/2024: 15626, 12/15/2024: 14637, 12/22/2024: 11670, 12/29/2024: 12857, 01/05/2025: 18593, 01/12/2025: 18593, 01/19/2025: 16813, 01/26/2025: 18593, 02/02/2025: 19385, 02/09/2025: 18198, 02/16/2025: 17604, 02/23/2025: 19780, 03/02/2025: 19582, 03/09/2025: 17802, 03/16/2025: 18396, 03/23/2025: 19385, 03/30/2025: 18396, 04/06/2025: 16418, 04/13/2025: 18000, 04/20/2025: 16813, 04/27/2025: 19187, 05/04/2025: 19187, 05/11/2025: 16813, 05/18/2025: 17209, 06/08/2025: 16813, 06/15/2025: 16220, 06/22/2025: 16022, 06/29/2025: 15824, 07/06/2025: 15429, 07/13/2025: 15429, 07/20/2025: 15429, 07/27/2025: 15231, 08/03/2025: 15429, 08/10/2025: 15626, 08/17/2025: 15824, 08/24/2025: 16615, 08/31/2025: 17209, 09/07/2025: 17209, 09/14/2025: 17802, 09/21/2025: 18000, 09/28/2025: 17604, 10/05/2025: 17802, 10/12/2025: 18198, 10/19/2025: 18000, 10/26/2025: 18593, 11/02/2025: 18791, 11/09/2025: 18396, 11/16/2025: 18593, 11/23/2025: 18000, 11/30/2025: 16615, 12/07/2025: 16418, 12/14/2025: 15626, 12/21/2025: 15429, 12/28/2025: 16022, 01/04/2026: 17011, 01/11/2026: 17604, 01/18/2026: 18791, 01/25/2026: 19582, 02/01/2026: 19582, 02/08/2026: 20176, 02/15/2026: 20176, 02/22/2026: 19780, 03/01/2026: 20176, 03/08/2026: 20176, 03/15/2026: 19780, 03/22/2026: 20176, 03/29/2026: 19978, 04/05/2026: 19385, 04/12/2026: 19187, 04/19/2026: 18989, 04/26/2026: 18396, 05/03/2026: 18791, 05/10/2026: 18791"

"methane","Methane (CH₄) is a colorless, odorless, and highly flammable gas that is the simplest alkane and the main component of natural gas. It is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential many times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, making it a significant contributor to climate change. Methane is produced both naturally and through human activities, such as the decomposition of organic matter in wetlands, the digestive processes of ruminant animals, and the extraction and transport of fossil fuels.","industry,lifestyle,science,energy,manufacturing,gardening-agriculture","No","+6%",135000,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Negative","Growing","Past 1 year","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/methane","Facebook: 0.88, Instagram: 0.84, LinkedIn: 1.00, Pinterest: 0.87, Reddit: 0.95, TikTok: 0.80, Twitter: 1.00, YouTube: 0.97","06/02/2024: 29492, 06/09/2024: 30443, 06/16/2024: 25687, 06/23/2024: 24735, 06/30/2024: 22357, 07/07/2024: 23784, 07/14/2024: 24735, 07/21/2024: 23308, 07/28/2024: 24735, 08/04/2024: 21881, 08/11/2024: 24735, 08/18/2024: 25687, 08/25/2024: 29968, 09/01/2024: 29016, 09/08/2024: 33773, 09/15/2024: 35676, 09/22/2024: 37579, 09/29/2024: 35200, 10/06/2024: 35676, 10/13/2024: 35676, 10/20/2024: 39006, 10/27/2024: 32822, 11/03/2024: 38054, 11/10/2024: 39957, 11/17/2024: 42336, 11/24/2024: 35200, 12/01/2024: 47568, 12/08/2024: 43287, 12/15/2024: 31871, 12/22/2024: 22357, 12/29/2024: 25211, 01/05/2025: 37579, 01/12/2025: 38530, 01/19/2025: 38054, 01/26/2025: 38530, 02/02/2025: 43287, 02/09/2025: 42336, 02/16/2025: 41384, 02/23/2025: 41384, 03/02/2025: 42336, 03/09/2025: 38530, 03/16/2025: 40433, 03/23/2025: 38054, 03/30/2025: 38054, 04/06/2025: 36627, 04/13/2025: 32822, 04/20/2025: 40909, 04/27/2025: 39006, 05/04/2025: 38054, 05/11/2025: 35676, 05/18/2025: 33773, 05/25/2025: 31395, 06/08/2025: 29016, 06/15/2025: 28065, 06/22/2025: 27114, 06/29/2025: 27589, 07/06/2025: 26638, 07/13/2025: 25211, 07/20/2025: 26162, 07/27/2025: 26162, 08/03/2025: 26638, 08/10/2025: 28541, 08/17/2025: 29968, 08/24/2025: 31395, 08/31/2025: 35200, 09/07/2025: 36152, 09/14/2025: 36627, 09/21/2025: 38530, 09/28/2025: 38530, 10/05/2025: 37579, 10/12/2025: 39006, 10/19/2025: 38530, 10/26/2025: 37579, 11/02/2025: 39006, 11/09/2025: 38530, 11/16/2025: 37103, 11/23/2025: 37579, 11/30/2025: 35200, 12/07/2025: 33298, 12/14/2025: 33298, 12/21/2025: 32822, 12/28/2025: 32822, 01/04/2026: 34249, 01/11/2026: 35676, 01/18/2026: 36152, 01/25/2026: 39006, 02/01/2026: 39957, 02/08/2026: 39957, 02/15/2026: 41860, 02/22/2026: 42336, 03/01/2026: 40909, 03/08/2026: 41860, 03/15/2026: 40909, 03/22/2026: 39482, 03/29/2026: 40433, 04/05/2026: 39482, 04/12/2026: 38054, 04/19/2026: 39482, 04/26/2026: 39482, 05/03/2026: 38054, 05/10/2026: 39006, 05/17/2026: 38054"
