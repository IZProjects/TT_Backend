"Microneedle patches","Microneedle patches are a type of transdermal drug delivery system that uses an array of tiny needles to painlessly penetrate the outer layer of the skin. These patches create microchannels that allow for the direct delivery of drugs, vaccines, or other therapeutic agents into the dermal or subdermal layers, improving the efficacy and speed of drug delivery compared to traditional methods. They are particularly beneficial for patients who are needle-phobic, require self-administration, or need enhanced drug absorption.","beauty,personal-care,skincare,health,ecommerce,cpg","No","+355%",5400,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 2 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/microneedle-patches","Facebook: 0.35, Instagram: 0.47, LinkedIn: 0.38, Pinterest: 0.49, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.57, Twitter: 0.36, YouTube: 0.40","06/01/2023: 1188, 07/01/2023: 1674, 08/01/2023: 1296, 09/01/2023: 1350, 10/01/2023: 1350, 11/01/2023: 1728, 12/01/2023: 1620, 01/01/2024: 1890, 02/01/2024: 1944, 03/01/2024: 1944, 04/01/2024: 2052, 05/01/2024: 2052, 06/01/2024: 2484, 07/01/2024: 3132, 08/01/2024: 2754, 09/01/2024: 2268, 10/01/2024: 2538, 11/01/2024: 3888, 12/01/2024: 2754, 01/01/2025: 3294, 02/01/2025: 2700, 03/01/2025: 3672, 04/01/2025: 5238, 05/01/2025: 5400, 06/01/2025: 5370, 07/01/2025: 5622, 08/01/2025: 5625, 09/01/2025: 5518, 10/01/2025: 5429, 11/01/2025: 5530, 12/01/2025: 5147, 01/01/2026: 5029, 02/01/2026: 4717, 03/01/2026: 4450, 04/01/2026: 4495, 05/01/2026: 4480"

"Infrared hair dryer","An infrared hair dryer is a hair styling tool that uses infrared heat technology to dry hair more gently and evenly compared to traditional hair dryers. The infrared heat penetrates the hair shaft, drying hair from the inside out, which helps reduce damage, improve moisture retention, and leave hair smoother and shinier. This type of hair dryer is typically favored by individuals with fine, curly, or damaged hair, as well as professional stylists seeking tools that minimize frizz and enhance hair health.","technology,beauty,haircare","No","+11%",2400,"Regular","Accelerating","High","Average","Positive","Growing","Past 2 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/infrared-hair-dryer","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.25, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.57, Reddit: 0.17, TikTok: 0.44, Twitter: 0.13, YouTube: 0.40","06/01/2023: 2171, 07/01/2023: 2628, 08/01/2023: 1942, 09/01/2023: 2285, 10/01/2023: 2457, 11/01/2023: 3142, 12/01/2023: 3257, 01/01/2024: 2800, 02/01/2024: 2514, 03/01/2024: 2742, 04/01/2024: 2514, 05/01/2024: 1714, 06/01/2024: 2114, 07/01/2024: 2057, 08/01/2024: 2114, 09/01/2024: 2171, 10/01/2024: 2514, 11/01/2024: 4057, 12/01/2024: 4400, 01/01/2025: 2800, 02/01/2025: 2857, 03/01/2025: 2685, 04/01/2025: 2685, 05/01/2025: 2400, 06/01/2025: 1963, 07/01/2025: 1937, 08/01/2025: 2063, 09/01/2025: 1899, 10/01/2025: 2335, 11/01/2025: 3172, 12/01/2025: 3208, 01/01/2026: 2849, 02/01/2026: 2528, 03/01/2026: 2382, 04/01/2026: 2335, 05/01/2026: 1985"
