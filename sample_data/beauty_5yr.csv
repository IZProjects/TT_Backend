Lip stain masques are primarily targeted at individuals seeking durable, low-maintenance lip color that lasts throughout the day without frequent reapplication.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,cpg","No","+1600%",590,"Regular","Accelerating","Low","Average","Positive","Declining","Past 5 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/lip-stain-masque","Facebook: 0.35, Instagram: 0.43, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.66, Reddit: 0.18, TikTok: 0.65, Twitter: 0.07, YouTube: 0.44","06/01/2020: 0, 07/01/2020: 0, 08/01/2020: 0, 09/01/2020: 0, 10/01/2020: 0, 11/01/2020: 0, 12/01/2020: 0, 01/01/2021: 0, 02/01/2021: 0, 03/01/2021: 0, 04/01/2021: 0, 05/01/2021: 0, 06/01/2021: 0, 07/01/2021: 0, 08/01/2021: 0, 09/01/2021: 0, 10/01/2021: 0, 11/01/2021: 0, 12/01/2021: 0, 01/01/2022: 0, 02/01/2022: 0, 03/01/2022: 0, 04/01/2022: 0, 05/01/2022: 0, 06/01/2022: 0, 07/01/2022: 0, 08/01/2022: 0, 09/01/2022: 0, 10/01/2022: 0, 11/01/2022: 0, 12/01/2022: 0, 01/01/2023: 0, 02/01/2023: 0, 03/01/2023: 0, 04/01/2023: 0, 05/01/2023: 242, 06/01/2023: 208, 07/01/2023: 0, 08/01/2023: 485, 09/01/2023: 242, 10/01/2023: 0, 11/01/2023: 312, 12/01/2023: 416, 01/01/2024: 416, 02/01/2024: 312, 03/01/2024: 381, 04/01/2024: 381, 05/01/2024: 242, 06/01/2024: 451, 07/01/2024: 520, 08/01/2024: 832, 09/01/2024: 728, 10/01/2024: 798, 11/01/2024: 1075, 12/01/2024: 1318, 01/01/2025: 1318, 02/01/2025: 1006, 03/01/2025: 1214, 04/01/2025: 902, 05/01/2025: 590, 06/01/2025: 542, 07/01/2025: 573, 08/01/2025: 553, 09/01/2025: 349, 10/01/2025: 249, 11/01/2025: 356, 12/01/2025: 414, 01/01/2026: 344, 02/01/2026: 136, 03/01/2026: 92, 04/01/2026: 105, 05/01/2026: 37"

Hair texture powder is popular among individuals looking to enhance hair volume, achieve effortless, tousled styles, or extend the time between washes.","beauty,haircare,personal-care,cpg","No","+1333%",33100,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Neutral","Stationary","Past 5 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/hair-texture-powder","Facebook: 0.37, Instagram: 0.41, LinkedIn: 0.00, Pinterest: 0.39, Reddit: 0.17, TikTok: 0.71, Twitter: 0.07, YouTube: 0.37","06/01/2020: 2309, 07/01/2020: 2694, 08/01/2020: 2694, 09/01/2020: 2309, 10/01/2020: 2309, 11/01/2020: 1539, 12/01/2020: 2309, 01/01/2021: 1924, 02/01/2021: 1924, 03/01/2021: 2309, 04/01/2021: 3079, 05/01/2021: 2694, 06/01/2021: 2694, 07/01/2021: 2694, 08/01/2021: 3463, 09/01/2021: 4233, 10/01/2021: 3848, 11/01/2021: 5003, 12/01/2021: 4618, 01/01/2022: 3463, 02/01/2022: 3848, 03/01/2022: 4233, 04/01/2022: 4233, 05/01/2022: 4618, 06/01/2022: 4618, 07/01/2022: 4233, 08/01/2022: 5003, 09/01/2022: 4618, 10/01/2022: 4618, 11/01/2022: 4618, 12/01/2022: 5003, 01/01/2023: 5773, 02/01/2023: 6158, 03/01/2023: 5773, 04/01/2023: 6158, 05/01/2023: 6158, 06/01/2023: 8852, 07/01/2023: 9237, 08/01/2023: 10006, 09/01/2023: 11161, 10/01/2023: 12701, 11/01/2023: 15395, 12/01/2023: 17704, 01/01/2024: 15395, 02/01/2024: 16934, 03/01/2024: 16165, 04/01/2024: 17704, 05/01/2024: 18089, 06/01/2024: 17319, 07/01/2024: 18474, 08/01/2024: 24247, 09/01/2024: 25402, 10/01/2024: 27711, 11/01/2024: 31945, 12/01/2024: 36179, 01/01/2025: 35409, 02/01/2025: 38103, 03/01/2025: 38488, 04/01/2025: 35024, 05/01/2025: 33100, 06/01/2025: 32461, 07/01/2025: 32248, 08/01/2025: 32695, 09/01/2025: 32993, 10/01/2025: 33632, 11/01/2025: 35164, 12/01/2025: 35973, 01/01/2026: 35015, 02/01/2026: 34909, 03/01/2026: 33547, 04/01/2026: 31397, 05/01/2026: 29587"

"Microneedle Patches ","Microneedle patches are a relatively recent development in medical technology, designed to deliver drugs or vaccines through the skin in a minimally invasive way. They consist of an array of tiny needles, often made from materials like silicon, metal, or polymers, which are small enough to avoid causing pain but large enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin. This method can improve the delivery of medications by bypassing the digestive system and directly entering the bloodstream, potentially increasing the efficacy and speed of drug delivery.","beauty,skincare,health,makeup-cosmetics,personal-care,cpg","No","+870%",6600,"Exploding","Exponential","Low","Low","Positive","Growing","Past 5 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/microneedle-patches-1","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.50, LinkedIn: 0.34, Pinterest: 0.51, Reddit: 0.23, TikTok: 0.59, Twitter: 0.36, YouTube: 0.40","06/01/2020: 680, 07/01/2020: 884, 08/01/2020: 748, 09/01/2020: 816, 10/01/2020: 884, 11/01/2020: 1088, 12/01/2020: 1428, 01/01/2021: 1088, 02/01/2021: 1088, 03/01/2021: 884, 04/01/2021: 1360, 05/01/2021: 884, 06/01/2021: 1088, 07/01/2021: 1088, 08/01/2021: 1292, 09/01/2021: 1156, 10/01/2021: 1020, 11/01/2021: 1292, 12/01/2021: 1496, 01/01/2022: 2041, 02/01/2022: 1701, 03/01/2022: 1973, 04/01/2022: 2177, 05/01/2022: 1632, 06/01/2022: 1564, 07/01/2022: 1496, 08/01/2022: 1769, 09/01/2022: 2585, 10/01/2022: 1973, 11/01/2022: 1632, 12/01/2022: 1564, 01/01/2023: 2449, 02/01/2023: 2653, 03/01/2023: 2109, 04/01/2023: 1973, 05/01/2023: 1701, 06/01/2023: 1769, 07/01/2023: 1973, 08/01/2023: 1701, 09/01/2023: 1837, 10/01/2023: 1701, 11/01/2023: 2245, 12/01/2023: 2041, 01/01/2024: 2313, 02/01/2024: 2245, 03/01/2024: 2381, 04/01/2024: 2721, 05/01/2024: 2313, 06/01/2024: 3197, 07/01/2024: 3810, 08/01/2024: 3538, 09/01/2024: 2789, 10/01/2024: 3265, 11/01/2024: 4830, 12/01/2024: 3810, 01/01/2025: 4150, 02/01/2025: 3470, 03/01/2025: 4558, 04/01/2025: 6804, 05/01/2025: 6600, 06/01/2025: 7663, 07/01/2025: 8032, 08/01/2025: 8232, 09/01/2025: 8510, 10/01/2025: 9270, 11/01/2025: 10125, 12/01/2025: 9748, 01/01/2026: 10377, 02/01/2026: 10529, 03/01/2026: 10924, 04/01/2026: 12375, 05/01/2026: 12476"

"Microneedle patches","Microneedle patches are a type of transdermal drug delivery system that uses an array of tiny needles to painlessly penetrate the outer layer of the skin.

Hydrocolloid acne patches are commonly used by individuals with active pimples or minor skin blemishes, offering a discreet and effective spot-treatment solution.","beauty,makeup-cosmetics,skincare,personal-care,cpg","No","+119%",2900,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","Low","Positive","Stationary","Past 5 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/hydrocolloid-acne-patch","Facebook: 0.42, Instagram: 0.58, LinkedIn: 0.08, Pinterest: 0.55, Reddit: 0.15, TikTok: 0.55, Twitter: 0.04, YouTube: 0.36","06/01/2020: 1322, 07/01/2020: 1322, 08/01/2020: 1407, 09/01/2020: 1535, 10/01/2020: 1620, 11/01/2020: 1663, 12/01/2020: 2345, 01/01/2021: 4264, 02/01/2021: 2516, 03/01/2021: 2516, 04/01/2021: 2089, 05/01/2021: 1748, 06/01/2021: 2388, 07/01/2021: 2004, 08/01/2021: 1791, 09/01/2021: 1663, 10/01/2021: 1364, 11/01/2021: 1066, 12/01/2021: 1236, 01/01/2022: 2217, 02/01/2022: 1876, 03/01/2022: 1833, 04/01/2022: 1364, 05/01/2022: 1620, 06/01/2022: 1535, 07/01/2022: 1407, 08/01/2022: 1791, 09/01/2022: 1322, 10/01/2022: 1236, 11/01/2022: 980, 12/01/2022: 1620, 01/01/2023: 1620, 02/01/2023: 2175, 03/01/2023: 1663, 04/01/2023: 1961, 05/01/2023: 1279, 06/01/2023: 1833, 07/01/2023: 1876, 08/01/2023: 2047, 09/01/2023: 1919, 10/01/2023: 1705, 11/01/2023: 1407, 12/01/2023: 1876, 01/01/2024: 1705, 02/01/2024: 1450, 03/01/2024: 1961, 04/01/2024: 1705, 05/01/2024: 1876, 06/01/2024: 2686, 07/01/2024: 2004, 08/01/2024: 2516, 09/01/2024: 1748, 10/01/2024: 1961, 11/01/2024: 2302, 12/01/2024: 2004, 01/01/2025: 2089, 02/01/2025: 2302, 03/01/2025: 2473, 04/01/2025: 2644, 05/01/2025: 2900, 06/01/2025: 3023, 07/01/2025: 2928, 08/01/2025: 2851, 09/01/2025: 2663, 10/01/2025: 2503, 11/01/2025: 2444, 12/01/2025: 2525, 01/01/2026: 2949, 02/01/2026: 2917, 03/01/2026: 2826, 04/01/2026: 2896, 05/01/2026: 2885"

Cryofacials are primarily targeted at individuals seeking quick, non-surgical methods to improve skin appearance and reduce signs of aging.","beauty,health,skincare,personal-care","No","+27%",14800,"Peaked","Stationary","Low","Low","Positive","Declining","Past 5 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/cryofacial","Facebook: 0.59, Instagram: 0.70, LinkedIn: 0.50, Pinterest: 0.42, Reddit: 0.06, TikTok: 0.60, Twitter: 0.39, YouTube: 0.47","06/01/2020: 11684, 07/01/2020: 12463, 08/01/2020: 15578, 09/01/2020: 11684, 10/01/2020: 15578, 11/01/2020: 12463, 12/01/2020: 14021, 01/01/2021: 13242, 02/01/2021: 10126, 03/01/2021: 14800, 04/01/2021: 21810, 05/01/2021: 16357, 06/01/2021: 21810, 07/01/2021: 19473, 08/01/2021: 16357, 09/01/2021: 14021, 10/01/2021: 19473, 11/01/2021: 20252, 12/01/2021: 17915, 01/01/2022: 19473, 02/01/2022: 26484, 03/01/2022: 24926, 04/01/2022: 28821, 05/01/2022: 28821, 06/01/2022: 28042, 07/01/2022: 28042, 08/01/2022: 77894, 09/01/2022: 33494, 10/01/2022: 32715, 11/01/2022: 28042, 12/01/2022: 35831, 01/01/2023: 34273, 02/01/2023: 34273, 03/01/2023: 37389, 04/01/2023: 36610, 05/01/2023: 28821, 06/01/2023: 29600, 07/01/2023: 31157, 08/01/2023: 31157, 09/01/2023: 32715, 10/01/2023: 31157, 11/01/2023: 35052, 12/01/2023: 21810, 01/01/2024: 43621, 02/01/2024: 35052, 03/01/2024: 30378, 04/01/2024: 28042, 05/01/2024: 28042, 06/01/2024: 22589, 07/01/2024: 17915, 08/01/2024: 20252, 09/01/2024: 16357, 10/01/2024: 15578, 11/01/2024: 15578, 12/01/2024: 18694, 01/01/2025: 17136, 02/01/2025: 22589, 03/01/2025: 22589, 04/01/2025: 17915, 05/01/2025: 14800, 06/01/2025: 10376, 07/01/2025: 12366, 08/01/2025: 14623, 09/01/2025: 8144, 10/01/2025: 8747, 11/01/2025: 7673, 12/01/2025: 7721, 01/01/2026: 10195, 02/01/2026: 10979, 03/01/2026: 10134, 04/01/2026: 8807, 05/01/2026: 6676"
