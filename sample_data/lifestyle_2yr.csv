AdBlue is primarily used by diesel vehicle owners and operators seeking to comply with environmental regulations and reduce their vehicles' environmental impact.","technology,industry,lifestyle,automotive,eco","No","+1%",450000,"Exploding","Exponential","Medium","Average","Negative","Declining","Past 2 years","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/adblue","Facebook: 1.00, Instagram: 0.96, LinkedIn: 0.88, Pinterest: 0.76, Reddit: 0.92, TikTok: 0.97, Twitter: 0.76, YouTube: 0.93","06/01/2023: 444000, 07/01/2023: 474000, 08/01/2023: 468000, 09/01/2023: 420000, 10/01/2023: 402000, 11/01/2023: 384000, 12/01/2023: 396000, 01/01/2024: 444000, 02/01/2024: 444000, 03/01/2024: 432000, 04/01/2024: 414000, 05/01/2024: 450000, 06/01/2024: 450000, 07/01/2024: 486000, 08/01/2024: 498000, 09/01/2024: 444000, 10/01/2024: 480000, 11/01/2024: 438000, 12/01/2024: 474000, 01/01/2025: 492000, 02/01/2025: 480000, 03/01/2025: 468000, 04/01/2025: 444000, 05/01/2025: 450000, 06/01/2025: 463711, 07/01/2025: 482409, 08/01/2025: 474681, 09/01/2025: 474930, 10/01/2025: 468698, 11/01/2025: 458725, 12/01/2025: 454986, 01/01/2026: 458725, 02/01/2026: 457479, 03/01/2026: 462714, 04/01/2026: 438781, 05/01/2026: 437119"
