"Ionic Thermal Brush","An ionic thermal brush is a heated styling tool that combines the functionality of a hairbrush with ionic and thermal technology to style and smooth hair. It uses negative ions to reduce frizz and static while evenly distributing heat to straighten or add volume and shape to hair without the intense direct heat of a flat iron. This tool is primarily targeted at individuals seeking efficient, salon-like hair styling at home, especially those with frizzy, wavy, or slightly curly hair looking for smoothness and volume.","haircare,technology,beauty,cpg","No","+5100%",880,"Regular","Accelerating","Medium","High","Positive","Growing","Past 3 months","https://semrush.com/app/exploding-topics/topic/ionic-thermal-brush","Facebook: 0.39, Instagram: 0.08, LinkedIn: 0.00, Pinterest: 0.48, Reddit: 0.00, TikTok: 0.58, Twitter: 0.00, YouTube: 0.17","02/23/2025: 0, 03/02/2025: 0, 03/09/2025: 0, 03/16/2025: 0, 03/23/2025: 306, 03/30/2025: 393, 04/06/2025: 318, 04/13/2025: 0, 04/20/2025: 263, 04/27/2025: 362, 05/04/2025: 86, 05/11/2025: 188, 05/18/2025: 204, 06/08/2025: 232, 06/15/2025: 279, 06/22/2025: 125, 06/29/2025: 145, 07/06/2025: 306, 07/13/2025: 232, 07/20/2025: 102, 07/27/2025: 240, 08/03/2025: 326, 08/10/2025: 157, 08/17/2025: 141, 08/24/2025: 314, 08/31/2025: 263, 09/07/2025: 106, 09/14/2025: 220, 09/21/2025: 326, 09/28/2025: 173, 10/05/2025: 122, 10/12/2025: 303, 10/19/2025: 291, 10/26/2025: 122, 11/02/2025: 216, 11/09/2025: 381, 11/16/2025: 236, 11/23/2025: 137, 11/30/2025: 350, 12/07/2025: 381, 12/14/2025: 161, 12/21/2025: 216, 12/28/2025: 405, 01/04/2026: 263, 01/11/2026: 122, 01/18/2026: 291, 01/25/2026: 354, 02/01/2026: 161, 02/08/2026: 177, 02/15/2026: 385, 02/22/2026: 295, 03/01/2026: 129, 03/08/2026: 295, 03/15/2026: 401, 03/22/2026: 196, 03/29/2026: 169, 04/05/2026: 393, 04/12/2026: 342, 04/19/2026: 141, 04/26/2026: 283, 05/03/2026: 440, 05/10/2026: 240, 05/17/2026: 161"
